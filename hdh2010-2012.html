      When did (the tradition) Hoon Dok Hae start? -- October, 1997. If you are missing someone -- do Hoon Dok Hae for them for 7 years and see what happens. I want you to read this speech very carefully without subtracting or adding (any content).

      The last Hoon Dok Hae (Sept. 20, 2011), 22 ½ hours was Father longest Hoon Dok Hae.
    </p><p>
      True Parents called the pastors here to make a unity condition with Korea and to launch the beginning of a global family. This was much of the focus of Fathers 22 ½ hour Hoon Dok Hae.

      On July 1 at Blue Sea Garden in Yeosu, Father hosted Hoon Dok Hae for <b>twenty-three and a half hours</b> for Japanese women participating in a forty-day workshop for "world ocean leaders." Even for the relatively young women, it was difficult, but they stayed from beginning to end.
    </p><p/><p/><p><b>... </b></p><p/><p><b>Today, at this morning's Hoon Dok Hae. Then, what is the significance of this morning's Hoon Dok Hae? It signifies that night and day are no longer separated. </b></p><p>
      .
    </p><p>
      This morning's Hoon Dok Hae is the time to clarify this. What I have given you to read for Hoon Dok Hae is simple content. Just as the families who came to the ocean at the beginning of this workshop were transformed in eight days, the world's nations will be turned upside down in eight days. What would remain behind for those who have their nations in that new realm after the fire burning at 300 million degrees? <b>You need to know that any being that has received the seed of true love cannot be burned, even by the fire of the sun</b>....
    </p><p/><p>
      The issue is that we are now living in an era when people can generate heat at 300 million degrees. What does that mean? It refers to the philosophy of victory, that is, Goodism. Though it may seem that Satan won the war and has remained triumphant, it is actually God who, after a course of suffering, won the victory

<p>
      Yesterday, I talked the whole day, and you will say, "Why does Father talk again about what he said yesterday?" In order to indemnify every time when there is a failure, conditions must continue to be made repeatedly, but you will say, "Why does Father repeat the same thing?" That's why you are getting farther from me, instead of getting closer. Satan knows such things and utilize such a strategy, but you don't know it. What shall I do then? Should I just leave such people? I have to kick them out. That's why at the time of concluding the providence, I think that I shouldn't meet you. When I see you 10 times, you should know what I am saying at least two or three times. If you pretend to understand but actually have no clue for all the 10 times, what shall I do?
    </p><p>
      Some think I speak something different from what they expect without resolving their own problems and they don't want to listen to the principles. That is wrong. Others come here several times but doze every time. They shouldn't come here. So I must say you should know the principle. Those who come to Hoon Dok Hae for the first time have no clue about what I am saying, and when I repeat some points, they say 'Father is strange. Why does he say that again?' Why do some people come to this place thinking to solve their own familial problem?
    </p><p/><p>
      You should come here with understanding what you will listen here that day. What you listened here from the reading can be your direction to go and goals for that day but you don't think that way, and so what can I do? You should know Satan is working on you that way. Satan says 'You don't need these words and what you think is right.' That's why you should know the principle.
    </p><p>
      What I said 10 years ago and 20 years ago are the same. Some say, 'I came here for the first time and all what Father did was scold us.' Why do they come the first time? There are some members who come here every day, and so those who come here for the first time are bystanders who make rumors and make trouble.
    </p><p/><p>
      You must read my eight textbooks and teaching materials. Some have not read this speech (of the Cosmic Assembly for the Proclamation of the Settlement of the True Parents of Heaven, Earth, and Humankind and the Substantial Word of God) even once. I have been reading this everyday and wait for Hoon Dok Hae everyday thinking, 'What will I listen to tomorrow morning?' But some think 'Why does Father say that?' and so as time goes by, those who are long-time members end up leaving the church.
    </p><p>
      I must come here to the meeting without knowing the contents of my speech to read that day. I would criticize them otherwise. When reading, I am serious and don't doze like a bystander. Some say while dozing 'I don't understand what Father is saying.' Do I have to educate such people here? When you have something different in your mind at Hoon Dok Hae, you doze. I can't doze and if I do so, I must repent. After the meeting, I criticize myself thinking 'Because of this and that, I dozed forgetting the environment I was in.' You must think of everything centering on the principle but you don't."
    </p><p>
      "I am scared with my speech the most. You come here to learn but you have so many of your own thoughts and criticize the church. You will say 'Oh, I hear the same contents every day,' but that is not true. Everyday, your understanding could be deeper and wider."
    </p><p/><p>
      "Why don't you bring the speech file? Why don't you write down what you listen?"

      "Hoon Dok Hae here is realized under one direction where the God of Night, the God of Day and True Parents are one, and so you should be with the same direction after the meeting too. Hyoyul! do you know that? ('Yes.') You need to teach that to all members. When you pray in the morning by yourself in the harmony of heaven and earth, there is the spot one meter and 40 cm in front of you and you should offer bow together with,,,,,. The spirit world is watching you and so if you offer Jung Sung such way for three months, your mind is settled."

      Like all human beings, Father has the spirit self and the physical self, both of which consist of 'mind' and 'body' respectively: The spirit self has a spirit mind and spirit body, and the physical self has a physical mind and physical body. When we see people on earth, we only see their physical self, not their spirit self. By the same token, when we see people in the spirit world where we exist as a spirit self, we only see their spirit body, not their spirit mind.

      "God is the Internal God, <b>and Adam and Eve are to be the external God</b>. God created human beings as His substantial object partner of love. God, dwelling in Adam and Eve, will become our Parent. If so, the first son will be born of God's lineage of love. So is the second son. Due to the fall, the first son became that of Satan. If not for the fall, centering on God's love, God could have had His son through Adam and Eve. Satan came to occupy God's position, and therefore, human beings came to be in a position where they have two owners, God and Satan. <b>Since Satan knows that too, it can't take human beings without conditions</b>. The first love in the fall came through the relationship with Satan, but the second one, though it was still the fall, came through the relationship with Adam. Adam was to be Eve's husband that God gives and is to be the owner of love."

      In terms of the Principle, the inspirational and internal spherical form of God as He brings the providence to its conclusion can be expressed more simply as a being of dual characteristics in harmonious union. Those who do not know about the being of dual characteristics in harmonious union will disappear in the end. If a woman does not know a man, and vice versa, they too will disappear. There will be no children, no family and no nation. The fundamental being of dual characteristics in harmonious union... Isn't the Principle and the Unification Church faith truly wonderful? Since God is a being of dual characteristics in harmonious union, can a man and a woman be the same? No, they are different

      The words 'true love' are scary. I unified the spirit and physical world with the words of true love. I am 93 years old now and if I start my course again now, it will be only true love that I can leave behind. Your future is bright and be someone who can give anything.

      The term 'true love' is a truly terrible one. With the term 'true love,' I united the spiritual and physical worlds. True love can prosper forever only when you live for others. Everything will end when you say that you will make others live for you, in the name of true love. I am now ninety-three years old, and even if I were to begin my life all over again, the only thing I would leave behind me is the term 'true love.' The gate to a bright future has been opened for today's young people. I hope that you will all endeavor to give at least something to others.

      "True love means True Parents' love, and true love will never disappear. After you give it and others become happy, the cosmos will embrace you.

      Satan came to occupy God's position, and therefore, human beings came to be in a position where they have two owners, God and Satan. Since Satan knows that too, it can't take human beings without conditions. The first love in the fall came through the relationship with Satan, but the second one, though it was still the fall, came through the relationship with Adam. Adam was to be Eve's husband that God gives and is to be the owner of love.

      Originally, perfected human beings are a valuable existence which can dominate the angelic world and the whole cosmos. But due to the fall, they fell down by several ranks, and so they must go up to their original state. In that course, <b>they can't make it at once</b>: t<b>hey should go up step by step </b>through the course of restoration starting from the individual level to the familial, tribal, racial, national, and the worldwide levels.

      What is the fall? It is the fall that father, for example, can't be in the position of father, and that the son becomes a betrayer. Such a thing can happen, not only at the time of Adam and Eve, but even now. People are fighting but they don't know if they are on God's side or Satan's.

      I recently revealed this: did God have a brother or not? What do you think? God created Adam, Eve and the angelic world not only by Himself. Nobody knows this. I found out as the responsible person for this world that God didn't create Adam only by Himself. Then who created His brother? God, to become the elder brother, created His younger brother, the archangel, which is ?/ servant. God couldn't do the creation by Himself, but did it together with His brother. God and His brother, as the subject and object partners, discussed and supported each other for the purpose. Without a partner, there is no happiness and so in the process of creation there was '?/ elder brother' and '??/ younger brother.' God, together with His younger brother, started to create Adam and Eve. Why did God create His brother half-perfected and started to create Adam and Eve? Adam and Eve would have been son and daughter of '?/ Elder Brother (God)' and there was an amazing promise that after Adam and Eve started their family, the Elder Brother (God) would give an even better son and daughter for His '??/ younger brother.' That's why Lucifer as the younger brother, was happy in the process of the creation. From this perspective, the beginning of the cosmos is Adam's family created with joy by elder and younger brothers.

      Lucifer had become the ancestor of humankind. The middle syllable of the name Lucifer is not <i>shi </i>but <i>sshi </i>(meaning seed). We received Satan's blood. We became Lucifer's fruit. The three archangels were Lucifer, Gabriel and Michael. Lucifer was the central archangel. He created the devil's tradition and planted the devil's seeds. Those seeds didn't die. They occupied the world and all of heaven and earth, and the God of Night and the God of Day, the Creator, was lost. How can we reveal the terrible original basis of the Fall? It is not in the Principle of Creation. What caused this? What is the Fall?...

      God has never apologized for the history of restoration. Has the Bible given excuses for history? Truth is eternal, and God is eternal. Whoever denies God is truly a miserable being. Therefore, to give such a miserable being your apology or explanation is not logical. If you are true, you don't need to explain or apologize what you do. You will expand and progress despite being persecuted.

      Though I couldn't see anyone, I felt someone embrace me and touch me. Though it seemed no one was there, I felt a touch on my hand. Though I couldn't see it, the touch of that hand is so different. It is a dream-prison(mN: should be dream-person) like story, and something that you could not understand even if I were to tell it to you. Even if I talk about it for ten thousand years, these words go deeper than ten thousand years and it is difficult to understand and practice them.

      The conclusion is that God is a man (mN: though He has dual characteristics). Since He is a man, does He need a wife or not? [He needs a wife.] How do you know? [Laughter] Why does He need a wife? It's not because He requires female companionship. He absolutely needs a wife because she is His absolutely necessary master. Therefore, those who say that He doesn't need a wife are all insane!

      What is ohdookshin? ('When Father was a child, Father saw it at the crossroad.') At any crossroad, ohdookshin appeared to me. When I was alone at the crossroads, I couldn't see it. But later in my life when the order was not clearly made between Father, brothers and sisters and me, and there were conflicts, I had to cross over all the crossroads of east, west, south and north. How could I do that? Heaven sent me a ghost called ohdookshin. Every time I was at the crossroad, I knew which is east, west, south or north, and the ohdookshin, for example, waited in the west, and talked down to me saying 'Yong Myeong! You came here again. Today your direction is different since I am in the west and you are in the east." A direction could be at any degree, and if you can't be sure which direction is east, west, south or north, ohdookshin would sit on you pushing and pulling you."

      On July 1 at Blue Sea Garden in Yeosu, Father hosted Hoon Dok Hae for twenty-three and a half hours for Japanese women participating in a forty-day workshop for "world ocean leaders." Even for the relatively young women, it was difficult, but they stayed from beginning to end.

      To find what has been lost by the invisible God (God of Night) and the God of Day, the path of indemnity needs to be followed through the one, two, four, and seven dimensions, and on the basis of that triumph, your blessing should blossom and the completion of the unified Cheon II Guk will take place in Korea, our homeland.
    </p><p/><p>
      On that basis -- after all that is done -- God will be enthroned, on the foundation of the new life, the seed of love and the rectified bloodline, and His presence will be known. What day is set for this manifestation? <b>Today, at this morning's Hoon Dok Hae. Then, what is the significance of this morning's Hoon Dok Hae? It signifies that night and day are no longer separated. </b></p><p>
      .
    </p><p>
      This morning's Hoon Dok Hae is the time to clarify this. What I have given you to read for Hoon Dok Hae is simple content. Just as the families who came to the ocean at the beginning of this workshop were transformed in eight days, the world's nations will be turned upside down in eight days. What would remain behind for those who have their nations in that new realm after the fire burning at 300 million degrees? <b>You need to know that any being that has received the seed of true love cannot be burned, even by the fire of the sun</b>....
    </p><p/><p>
      The issue is that we are now living in an era when people can generate heat at 300 million degrees. What does that mean? It refers to the philosophy of victory, that is, Goodism. Though it may seem that Satan won the war and has remained triumphant, it is actually God who, after a course of suffering, won the victory

      "Who is Lucifer? You understand him as the archangel but who is he in the relationship with the God of Night? Lucifer means 'the seed and the fruits of the Louvre.' Who is Gabriel? Who is Michael? 'Michael means 'since there was no home, it had an abortion.' Since I know the fundamental issues I interpret their names such way, but you do not know anything about it.

      You do not know if they are three brothers or not. Lucifer is God's younger brother. When God created<b> the cosmos and Adam and Eve</b>, it was Lucifer who helped Him. Do you know that?

      When Adam and Eve become perfect observing absolute sexual morality,<b>  they become the Substantial True Parents and the God of Day</b> <b>Who is the God of Body</b>. This means they become the Creator, King of Kings and God incarnate.

      (mN: So now, True Parents are the God of Day, King of Kings and Body of God ?)

      God, the unique being! From an early age, I knew that Korean people serve the one being who is more awesome and amazing than any other. Though I couldn't see anyone, I felt someone embrace me and touch me. Though it seemed no one was there, I felt a touch on my hand. Though I couldn't see it, the touch of that hand is so different. It is a dream-like story, and something that you could not understand even if I were to tell it to you. Even if I talk about it for ten thousand years, these words go deeper than ten thousand years and it is difficult to understand and practice them.
    </p><p/><p>
      If there is one father who has a hundred sons and they are all really his, have you thought about whether the hundredth son would love the father? If there were more than fifty brothers and they were all lost, the heart of God and His desire to find them would be limitless. How can you express that in words ?
    </p><p/><p>
      ...............
    </p><p/><p/><p>
      If at present I have forgotten and do not know, and if the only other thing I could relate to were an animal and not a person, what would that matter? What would it matter if it were not a living being? What if it were an inanimate object? If it moved my heart more than any living being and aroused love in my heart, I would love it. Such is the heart of God at present, and you should know this....

      "God always has <font face="Gulim, sans-serif"><span lang="zxx">?</span></font>(<i>han </i><span style="font-style: normal">sorrow</span>, regret, or resentment) that He couldn't be the Father who could console and have the environmental factors that allows Him to encourage me. I can always almost see my blooming time of energy and hope when I urged myself to go to and be with Heavenly Father sacrificing everything of that time. Only those who experienced it can understand the earnestness of such heart. You should have such mind. In the valley of repentance, holding sorrowful situations with agonizing face where parents can have no sympathy, shedding tears of sadness rather than that of joy meant to me that it was the time of eternal farewell. I could hear the sound of weeping from the bones at the time. Who can know the situation of my youth, where I had to take the difficult path even knowing there was an easy path to go. That was an earnest heart. Even I am over 90 and reaching 100, I will never forget such heart. In such a world of heart, heavenly grace will gradually become bigger and bigger. You should have such a world in your life."

      "Where do you think God wants to send the Messiah? It is not to the fallen individual, family, tribe nor race. God's desire is to send the Messiah to the sovereignty in which a race and a nation are united. In order to subjugate Cain nations on Satan's side, God sends the Messiah to one nation. The Messiah is to come to the national level in order to subjugate the world. He was not to come to make a victory under a national level. Why? Due to the fall, the whole world was conquered by Satan and all the nations became satanic. Among all nations, there is always the number one nation of Satan, and the Roman Empire in Jesus' time was an example.
    </p><p/><p>
      The purpose of God sending the Messiah is to subjugate Satan and kick him out. Satan, who was originally the servant of human beings, cannot help but surrender to the original Adam. Though there are many nations on earth, there is only one that Satan wants to be proud of the most. God wants to raise one nation to the absolute standard to subjugate the Satanic nation. Centering on one religious thought through the people who offer Jeong Seong towards Heaven, God has been looking for one nation.

      Outside of Korea, there isn't a single person who does not know about the Unification Church. Here, there are homely looking people, people advanced in age, people who look humble and alone, however, when you go out to the other countries I am known by everybody, whether they have heard good or evil about me they may perceive Rev. Moon as a strange person, as an eccentric or one who is unable to think. <b>As time passes they will come to see that there will be a way to respect what Rev. Moon has done even if it means they should amend the laws in their country to do so</b>.

      Christianity could not receive True Parents. Because of that, the UN did not become the foundation for God to bring peace to the world. The ideal situation would have been that the UN Secretary General would be the spokesperson for True Parents. Were that the case, there would have been no need to create an Abel UN. That didn't happen, therefore, an Abel UN had to be established.

      At the time of the Second World War there was a religious foundation of Christianity but Christians didn't receive True Parents. That began a problem that several American presidents couldn't resolve. The American President cannot resolve these things. Nixon, Carter, Ford and Reagan.  You have no way of knowing how God and Satan were at war during the years of their administrations. Without True Parents they could not have been standing. I am an expert and no one knows the spiritual battles that were going on at this time.

      Each nation has different language and environment. In order to follow me, you must have the diplomatic power to run the world understanding the relationships in the international community. Do not follow others but pioneer your own way by running a risk of your own life. Foster your ability to conduct diplomacy and work to run a nation. When it comes to influencing the structure of a nation and the direction of its diplomacy, one needs to have networks and expertise. Now the Unification church is reaching the final point, and must leap from here. At this time, the most important thing is a human network

      When a person on the individual level meets Christ and wants to go up to the familial level, they must pay an indemnity condition on earth. Likewise, those who are on the familial level and want to go up to the tribal level must go through an indemnity course. Consequently, I can say the longer one has been with the Unification church, the more they have paid indemnity conditions. This means the longer you have been with the church, the closer you are to me. Until reaching the national level, we go up vertically, and then we must establish a national structure. <b>But until we reach such a level, we could experience falling down again and again. It is important how we can go beyond the national level and be settled</b>.

On that victorious foundation, individuals and families can come to have a base for victory.

      It was before I became 4 years old. I could understand everything people said in Korean. My grandparents and their daughters-in-law got together once regarding me, whose nick name was 'small-eyed boy of Osan house,' but they couldn't treat me as they liked. I heard the absolute voice, that said 'Yong Myung! You will go with your grandpa and what do you think of it? I know that you have heavenly wisdom which enables you to judge and evaluate fortune tellers and spiritualists, but your grandparents don't know it and so I am sorry they asked you, a child, to do so. I am sorry that you will be asked to do things, and all through your life, I will exchange questions and answers with you. You need to know clearly what kind of life you will lead, but you can guess now you must start your life for something fundamental.' I had heard such absolute voice many times."

      The following is a part of the reflection of Dr. David Carlson on Father's speech given at the Cheong Shim Peace World Center on 3.1 HC. I couldn't agree more with him, and I would like to post it here again. I have been feeling the same thing in listening to Father's speeches but couldn't organize it in words like Dr. Carlson did below. It is worth keeping it in mind when listening to Father. -- Katsumi Kambashi -
    </p><p style="margin-left: 0.79in"/><p>
      "<b>True Father does not speak in a linear, logical (i.e. Western) fashion</b>. He speaks about one point (which has a whole constellation of points around it) and then perhaps from one of those peripheral points goes to another point. <b>There is no "logical" connection but there is an <font size="4">intuitive, heartistic connection</font></b>. If our heart is resonant with his heart, we can follow easily, perhaps, but if not, if we look for the "logic" then we can become frustrated. True Father's thinking and speech is centered only on heart. That is, perhaps, unique with the Messiah."

Even it takes thousands of years, you must cure this disease and you must become famous. I came here to have a friendship with you.' I said, 'You bastard, what is this friendship?

Who are you? Identify yourself.' Then he ran away from me. So I went to the spirit world to find and meet him, and said "If I need to be so, why don't you tell me that you had been trained to be able to unify the God of Night and the God of Day!

      "When I became 17 years old in February, in Easter (Katsumi: Father mentioned both but it is not clear if there were two occasions), Jesus appeared to me saying 'The time has come. Therefore be my substitute and successor. Will you do what I said?' I said 'Hey you ghost, who are you?" Why (did I respond such way)? I knew the God of Night and the God of Day had been separated, and I didn't understand why the third party (who is Jesus) came to me and gave me directions. He did not know I had been through that difficult issue I had to solve. I said to him, 'Who do you think I am?' Before I asked that, I said, 'Do you know where I came from? I know the God of Night and the God of Day have been separated and there were the fallen parents. Who are you? You are the third person (after the God of Night and the God of Day) and so I must examine who you are. Do you know there are the God of Night and the God of Day?'

      In February, when I was seventeen, Jesus appeared. I knew that when he was young, he was driven away when he should have been welcomed. That's why he came to me. Jesus had much pain in his heart for having died and for the fact that his wedding ceremony had not taken place. He told me that I was the person who would make Jesus' wedding happen. This is what he told me to my face. Jesus was in the prime of his life. He told me "Yong Myung Moon, you have to prepare the venue, take the lead and bring me to it. Yong Myung Moon, you have to help me get married." Why? "Because, Yong Myung Moon, you are the ancestor."... You should make a signboard and put it up announcing that among the citizens of a nation, Rev. Moon is the king of fighting spirit who digests the world.

      "When I was 17 years old, Jesus came to me calling 'Mr. Yong Myung Moon. Let's go to receive the Blessing.' I said (raising his voice) 'Who are you, bastard! You are talking about the Blessing without knowing anything. Do you know the God of Night and the God of Day, you bastard?'
    </p><p/><p>
      He replied 'I don't care what you know, but I appear to you because the time has come. If I can't, I can't help but continue until I find (someone else).'

      (Katsumi: Father sounds rude to Jesus. But we need to keep in mind that Father implied before that when Jesus came to him for the first time, he was not sure if it was Jesus since he had seen so many spiritual beings.)

      No holy son was from the West. They are from the East. The first holy son who came was Jesus, and which nation did he come to?

      Jesus' spirit appeared to a boy called Yong Myung Moon when he was 17 years old. He knew my name. Jesus said to me, 'Let's go receive the Blessing.' We met each other for the first time, but those were his first words to me. (Raising his voice) '<font face="Gulim, sans-serif">???</font>, <font face="Gulim, sans-serif">????</font>! (You fool! Who are you?) Do you know the God of Night and the God of Day have been separated ? How dare you come to me saying such a thing?' (Jesus said) 'I have been preparing this and there has been a person in my mind as your wife.' I was 17 years old, and didn't decide that time (<font face="Gulim, sans-serif">??????</font>). Any boy who became 17 years old and hadn't thought of marriage, can't become a man. When they become 14, or 15 years old, they realize there is man and there is woman."

      When True Mother and True Father were Blessed, the situations of Jesus day had to be indemnified. Certainly there are huge differences between Mary Magdalene and True Mother  not least that True Mother was a pure and virginal young woman when she and Father were wed. Nevertheless, like Jesus would-be wife, True Mother faced and overcame incredible opposition from other church members, thereby indemnifying the disciples rejection of Mary Magdalene. <b>She received all the accusation aimed at the original Eve and then at Mary, <font size="4">digested it, and restored the wifes position</font>.</b></p></a> <a href="http://www.tongil.org/ucbooks/smmspeaks/2012/20120928-Wife_of_Jesus.html"><img src="hdh2010-2012.html_files/ilink.png" alt="User Link" style="border-width:0"/></a></div></li></ul></li>

      Now, on the foundation of True Mother victory (of indemnifying the disciples' rejection of Mary Magdalene), the story of Jesus wife can be revealed to humankind. Don Browns The Da Vinci Code enjoyed extraordinary popularity because the time has come to rehabilitate Mary Magdalene from obscurity. She was the predecessor of True Mother, and True Mother stands on the foundation of her devotion to Jesus.
    </p><p/><p>
      Let us do what Jesus disciples could not, and recognize True Mothers unparalleled devotion and loving oneness with True Father as making her far greater than any disciple possibly could be.

      "(Hyo Jin Nim's) 10,000 songs are his tearful confession of his repentance on his not trusting Father. Hyo Jin must have walked the path of the tradition that mother and children love and are united with each other, but he could not. (Before he passed away) he went to the Cheon Jeong Gung and asked Hoon Mo Nim to give him a chance to experience the spirit world for two hours so that he could trust nobody but Father."

<p>
      There is one secret of Hyo Jin and the song (mN:If I can dream)  we just heard reminded me of it. Making thousands of songs, he meant, 'My beloved father, please liberate your sad heart. I wish I could have one night in comfort when I can stay with you, mother and Heavenly Father, but why can't you have such time with me? I think it would work if you let me do what I want to do. But why can't you be the father that I like?' If he comes to mother and asks her to cry together, she cannot help but do so. Hyo Jin wandered in the fogs of tears and I could not save such a son. He once came to me to ask for letting him go to the spirit world for just three hours so that he can understand there the greatness of his father. He knew that he would go to the spirit world without living long. Like I cured by myself when I was in the prison, he said he would cure himself without going to the hospital.
    </p><p/><p>
      Since the spirit world taught him that he would leave earth soon, he said he could not be patient anymore and asked me to send him to the spirit world for just three hours. He went to Hoon Mo Nim, blocked her on her path, and said he would burn down a building under construction (if she does not help him on this regard). She said she couldn't do it by herself, and she said she could give an order for him to be able to go to the spirit world if True Parents permit it. Hoon Mo Nim asked me to give him permission of going to the spirit world to see the ideal world of creation for 30 minutes, if not one hour. She said if he does not come back within one hour and half, he would not be able to come back. So I said 'Go and come back within 30 minutes.' (Mother called Father on a cellular phone) (Mother 'What are you doing now?') I am talking about Hyo Jin.
    </p><p/><p>
      (Mother: "Hon Dok Hae goes on without having breakfast and lunch. It's been a long meeting, hasn't it?') I hope you would come here. (Mother: 'Please take lunch.') She said 'Eat breakfast and lunch.' (Laughter) But talking about death and the life of the son is more important. (Mother: 'Please eat lunch.') OK, I will eat and go out for fishing. Do not worry I will eat.
    </p><p/><p>
      (Katsumi: Then Father said Hyo Jin Nim had said he could or would not return because of some reason, but I don't clearly understand what Father said.)
    </p><p>
      Hoon Mo Nim asked me with tears. I said 'If he really wants to do so, let him do what he wants to do.' In such a way, I sent him to the spirit world. In the ceremony (of Seunghwa), nobody knows the heart of the father who cannot come to and console his son. Until now I cannot get rid of that sadness. (Sniffle of the participants)
    </p><p/><p>
      At the final moment (of the ceremony), I talked to my watch, 'You will live for more than half year from now on, and so please console him. You, beyond time and space, please listen to me.' After I asked my watch to do so, I put it on his arm. His wrist was smaller than mine and the watch could go up here (to his elbow). If he was alive and felt the warmness of the watch, he would have said, 'Father, my heart is broken.' Seeing him, I said 'Go in peace. I have prepared your path for you in the spirit world. I cannot help but observe my promise with you and so don't worry, go in peace. Do not forget the spirit of loyalty. Stand behind mother and attend her, and wait for her there.'
    </p><p/><p>
      "This son (Hyo Jin Nim) is now always ahead of me anywhere I go. When 172 Christian ministers came this time, I gave him the permission of giving the Blessing to patriots and women of virtues among the ancestors of the Moon tribe. Therefore he is busy now making a revolution there."

<p>
      Next, we will talk about Hyo Jin Nim's Seunghwa. On March 17, 2008, everyone, we were all working hard on the election in Korea, we heard the news that Hyo Jin Nim had passed away. While we were all concerned with the attitude of sinners, True Parents Said that Hyo Jin Nim did something great and at that time<b> I Sacrificed My Eldest Son <font size="4">for the sake of God's Homeland</font></b>. Hyo Jin should go on my behalf as God took the spirit world on my behalf. So, at this time Father is talking about the liberation of His Homeland, and talking about the Seunghwa of Hyo Jin Nim from God's View. From a human view, this is not something we would expect a Parent to say about His Child's death. In this way, Father is completely absorbed in fulfilling God's Providence.
    </p><p/><p>
      Father gave a title of the<b> <i>Lord of Filial Piety and Loyalty Who Will Open up the Garden of the Deepest Heaven</i></b>. So, Father Gave that and that title is a Blessing to Hyo Jin Nim to fulfill that role when He goes to spirit world. So, when True Parents go to the spirit world, they will open a world of the Kingdom of Heaven. That means that Heaven can be opened through Hyo Jin Nim's Seunghwa, His death. <b>When Hyo Jin Nim's Seunghwa Ceremony was completed, True Parents went to Hawaii and then to the western United States and stayed there for about ten days and offered Devotion to God for about ten days. During ten days, True Father did not sleep or eat; and, Father was experiencing the life of the bottom of hell. <font size="4">Father was suppressing His Sadness for Hyo Jin Nim's death</font>; and, He was offering the greatest Devotion and Love in order for Hyo Jin Nim to find His place in the spirit world. </b></p><p/><p>
      So, at the time, 22 testimonies of people who had been attending Father at the time said that it was very difficult for them to look at how much suffering Father was putting Himself through. Through a Special Ceremony on April 3rd, Hyo Jin Nim's Life on the earth was put into order completely by Father; and, Father Proclaimed that Father had set the Foundation for Hyo Jin Nim to fulfill the Role that is sought after by His Title.

      In my family, when I was praying all through the night Hyo Jin (when he was a child) got up saying, 'Dad! I am scared!' I said 'What happened?' He said 'I am hearing orchestral music from the sky!' I said, 'Don't worry. It is for the two of us. It is not scary and so sit down and listen to it. You could dance to the music with your hands and body.' He started to dance to the music when he was three or four years old.

      When I see Father closing his eyes and sitting and ask him to go to his room to take a rest, he always says 'No.' In the beginning, I felt so worried and also wondered a lot why he, as God incarnate, had to live that way. What I gradually learned and felt through my brief experiences is that<b> Father offers Jeong Seong at a level we don't know so that he won't leave even one crack in the providence</b>. I think we tend to see and judge them, thinking 'Why didn't they do it this way or that way?' from our point of view.  Every time Father needed to proclaim important messages, he came to Las Vegas, and I think we are in the process of understanding little by little our True Parents, who must put in order the spirit and physical worlds.

      "Martial arts is the most rapidly growing sport in the world."
    </p><p>
      "Father said that world peace must be promoted through soccer and martial arts."
    </p><p>
      "Martial arts is a method that makes men peaceful by releasing their energy."
    </p><p>
      "I have been in public mission for the past three years and have never showed my performance on purpose, because I thought the young people might misunderstand it just thinking 'It's cool!.' Rather, I have been focused on educating how to find True Parents as 'my Messiahs and parents,' and the unification of mind and body.
    </p><p/><p/><p>
      But this time when I was with True Father at Geomundo, Father told me to do it and he liked it. Then he told me to continue to do it. (Laughter) So I do it with this explanation. The martial art itself is not the best way to fight.
    </p><p/><p>
      True Father is the best performer who has subjugated Satan, and that's why I think we must be more focused on internal training. How to win without physical fight is more important. Physical strength will be deteriorating without fail and so we need to be more focused on obtaining the internal wisdom, mind-training and loving True Parents. But I personally love it and it is a big part of my life. So actually (by telling me to do the performance) Father liberated me in a sense. I tried to hide my feeling but Father said, "<font face="Gulim, sans-serif"><span lang="zxx">????</span></font>, <font face="Gulim, sans-serif"><span lang="zxx">????</span></font>!" (A leader, this bastard!) (Laughter). So, though I am still a little bit worried about the young people who see my performance, I am happy that Father liberated me on this."

      TF:"When our children practice martial arts, people respect, rather than fear, the kids of the Unification church. I am not talking about business here. 10 years from now on, those who don't know how to protect themselves won't be treated as humans. When anyone over 40 is trained on some of the skills for six months, they will be able to protect themselves. We can make textbooks and DVDs. Especially in the military, they must know martial arts. I will assign you from now on to train people. Give a big hand to Hyung Jin and Francisco (a Brazilian brother who did the performance that day)."
    </p><p/><p>
      (mN:below from Hyung Jin Nim)
    </p><p>
      Another thing one must be aware of is that Satan easily enters you when you do martial arts. If you do it so that you can seem powerful and splendid, it is false martial arts, which is meaningless like garbage. That is not true martial arts (<font face="Gulim, sans-serif">??</font>). True martial arts are necessary to dominate oneself before dominating the cosmos.
    </p><p/><p>
      I always wear this Buddhist rosary on my arm. During my training period, when I lost my mind, by touching this I could come to the original state of my mind. This is a tool and weapon for me. In martial arts, we use swords, nun chucks, and other weapons, but this rosary is a weapon too. This is the weapon to protect my mind.
    </p><p/><p>
      After I perform martial arts, I feel strong since I know I can easily kill people, and break their arms and legs. Such a feeling could be the center and domination of oneself, and then their martial arts become self-centered, and constantly try to become stronger. Such a person can't perform for long period, and without fail, later they will be killed or damaged badly by others. So in doing martial art, if one forgets a internal sense, they become self-centered thinking 'I am strong. I can win against people. I will kill them if they disturb me.'

      Among my relatives in the Moon clan, when I was a child, my mother's mother came from the Kim clan in Gyeongju and her father came from the Kim clan in Yeonan. I asked how it had been possible for two people with the same family name to marry. My grandmother and grandfather on my mother's side replied, "That was our error." When I was young, they took care of me without question. I would go to my grandmother on my mother's side and my uncle and his three siblings would make such a fuss, as if an earthquake had struck. If I visited them, even the daughters-in-law would ask if "Moondong-i" was coming. (Moondong-i: Father's nickname) They would say that they wanted to see me even if it meant missing their birthday celebration or any other celebration. "Our favorite day is when Moondong-i comes." That's how my grandmother and grandfather were. If I went there, all the royalty and those in uniform among the ancestors of the Kim clans in Gyeongju and Yeonan would appear and greet me. You will not find these words in the Divine Principle book....

      About 450 years ago a Korean wrote the Cham Gan Nok -- in which the prophesy of True Father's coming was clearly predicted. The Moon clan is not just an ordinary clan. In the prophecy there is a big table figuratively that supports God. The altar is huge and it should symbolize the time of peace and prosperity -- representing the four directions of North, East, South, West. At that time the world was thought to be flat.

      * Yun Guk Moon (Jan. 30, 1877 -- Jan. 2, 1958): True Father's great-uncle, a Christian minister and a graduate from Pyeong Yang Theological Seminary, who was the president of the North Pyeong Yang chapter of the March 1st movement in 1919.
    </p><p/><p>
      During his two-year imprisonment after the revolt,<b> he contributed 70,000 Yen to the provisional Korean government that was set up in Shanghai</b>, China during Japanese's annexation of Korea, and that brought tremendous financial diffiulties to the Moon family. He didn't tell anybody for what he had used the money, which eventually isolated him from the family including True Father as a young man.
    </p><p/><p><b>He knew English and Chinese philosophy</b>, <b>and was a close friend of Syngman Rhee, who later became the first president of the Republic of Korea</b>. He was also involved in the establishment of Osan school which turned out many patriots under Japanese dominion.
    </p><p/><p>
      After the Korean liberation from Japan, he, after having rejcted the offer for a chief post from the president Syngman Rhee, taught Chinese philosophy to his disciples without revealing his past, and died alone in a foreign land.
    </p><p/><p>
      He appeared in the dream of Mr. Yong Gi Moon (True Father's younger cousin) in 1970, through which the location of his tomb and his final days came to be known, and later Father transferred his body to Wonjoo.

      "Father has two granduncles. One of them Rev. Yun Guk Moon worked to win Korean independence from Japan, and Father has dedicated himself and his whole life to restore God's fatherland. When Father talks about his family, he often hesitates to do so (since it seems that he just boasts of it), and so when we found the articles of Rev. Yun Guk Moon, we thought we ourselves must testify Father's family. When I saw Father speaking about his childhood missing his family and hometown, I thought that it was our mission to release his <font face="Gulim, sans-serif">?</font>(han) and all emotions. It was really fortunate that Rev. Yun Guk Moon left a record of his life, which he made when he was 78 years old. (Showing the record by his handwriting) As Father said, this was well written by excellent handwriting. This can be a testimony to what Father has told us about his granduncle until now."
    </p><p/><p>
      "Among my ancestors, there are many people who held the title of <span lang="zxx"><font face="Gulim, sans-serif">??</font></span>(master or teacher)."
    </p><p>
      "In 1910, Rev. Yun Guk Moon joined the Presbyterian Church in Korea. He taught Chinese literature, and then from the ages of 35 to 36 for two years, he taught at private elementary schools in Jeong Ju."
    </p><p>
      "He made all those schools and gathered children of beggars who hadn't studied before."
    </p><p>
      "From 37 to 41 for five years, he studied at the Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Pyeong Yang, which is the most famous institute in Korean Christian history. Famous Christian leaders in Korea are all alumni of this seminary. I believe that Rev. Yun Guk Moon, by absorbing new knowledge and Christian theology at the institute, became determined to win the independence of Korea. He then worked as a pastor at three churches in Jeong Ju. According to Father, it was seven, not three."
    </p><p>
      "I (as a child) visited them all in order to know what kind of person my granduncle was. I investigated them."
    </p><p/><p>
      "In 1919, Rev. Yun Gok Moon joined the Samil Independence Movement(March 1st -- 3.1.), where he mobilized around 10,000 people who respected and trusted him and his words, such as the people in the region and the teachers and students of Osan Private High School in Jeong Ju (<span lang="zxx"><font face="Gulim, sans-serif">??????????</font></span>) he had founded with others. He was one of the people who signed the document which was later sent to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. During the Samil Independence Movement, he was surrounded and captured by 120 policemen. He was sent to Seoul and tortured there. We can imagine how hard it was by recalling the torture given to Father. He was sentenced to be in jail for two years but later he was released due to the special pardon for royal marriage. From his age of 44 to 50 for six years, he served as the pastor for three churches in his hometown.
    </p><p/><p>
      Two years after the Samil Independence Movement, he sent 70,000 Won to the Korean interim government in Shanghai through Rev. Suk Che Kim who was in Manchuria at the time. 70,000 Won in those days is roughly 7 million Won now. According to Father, Rev. Yun Guk Moon didn't only give the money, but also provided 8000 Won for Rev. Kim for his expenses. We need to understand that he donated so much money as the representative of the Moon family. Father says that his mother always sang 'Higher Ground' and his whole family were Christians.
    </p><p/><p>
      Though he was released from the jail, he was always followed by the police who considered him as the person at the first rank on the blacklist. After realizing the date and the place of his alleged re-arrest, he escaped to Chungcheongbuk-do and hid for three years there. Later he moved to Kangwong-do.
    </p><p/><p>
      Right after Korea gained her independence on Aug. 15, 1945, he went back to his hometown where he found the communists' strong control. He told his wife, children and relatives that he couldn't work as a pastor there, and left his hometown on Jan. 17, 1946. Like Father, who put one leg on the north side and the other on the south side and pledged to unify the South and North Korea, Rev. Yun Guk Moon pledged in front of Heaven 'I am heading for the South now but in my lifetime I will definitely defeat communism and raise the people.'
    </p><p/><p>
      His handwriting is full of vigor and it doesn't seem to be written by a person of 78, through which we can imagine his high-spirited final life."

Her twin brother died of chickenpox when he was 7, 8 years old after he had suffered from it for one year and eight months. When he was dying, he said to me, "Brother Yong Myung, I am going first (to the spirit world.) This is for the sake of you but also for our youngest sister to survive to the end in my family.' For the sake of my younger sister, my two elder brothers died too (mN:TF is the third son), and nobody knows where their graves are. After I accomplish the restoration of God's Fatherland, I need to make my family graveyard."

      "People whom I loved in my youth were all gone. My father, my mother, my brothers and sisters There is only one left, my youngest sister in North Korea. She had a twin elder brother, Yong Gwan (<font face="Gulim, sans-serif"><span lang="zxx">??</span></font>). Both caught chickenpox at the same time, and she survived but he passed away.

      "When I came back home, my elder sister asked me 'Where did you go?' and gave me something she hadn't eaten in front of parents and spared for me. It was more tasteful and interesting to eat such food than foods on the big table at the feast. Anyone who lives in laughter and dance, or even is in the position of the King, wouldn't be able to know the taste and joy of the poetic deep heart that I felt that time, I don't think Korea will fail because I can't afford to fail."

      When I was in prison, I became friends with a condemned man who was to be put to death the next day, so I learned what his father's heart was like. You cannot know what he feels until you are in his position. No one can know what the mother would feel unless you became her. It would be so difficult to meet someone, other than his mother, who would weep for him and say, "I'll be put to death in your place." He had no such friends.

      The spirit world is very complicated and if one becomes arrogant after realizing some parts of that world, they will fall down later. That's why you need the principle. Human fall means that the archangel and Adam could not become united with God. You need to be united with angels who help you and then you can shut out Satan.

      One can never produce their offspring in the spirit world. By connecting those who have been singles in the spirit world to True Parents in blood, they can be family members of the people of thousands years later. It is possible. For example, the age difference of Mrs. Hyeon Shil Kang and her husband is 1,400 years. The time has come when those who are single in the spirit world can be the ancestors too by receiving the Blessing with earthly persons and adopting children. Centering on the principle, one can be a couple with a person thousands years later, and this principle is eternal. Heung Tae (Korean National Messiah in Brazil)! Has your elder brother (who is in the spirit world) been Blessed? (Yes) You can do it for them on earth. How wonderful it is! They will attend you as their ancestors.

      I am a person with a lot of bitter sorrow. There was a place that I loved in my hometown, where I shed tears alone. I held onto the boulders on the hill alone and prayed to become a friend to that friendless hill. I had no friends. If I talk more about this, it would seem as if I had been miserable....

      I overcame all difficulties. There is the expression for perseverance -- chil jeon pal gi. Fall down seven times, but get up eight times. I have walked down a hard path of death, a deep path of resurrection that would bring all people of the world to weep. God was dormant, as if he had disappeared, yet He can re-create Himself and revive. That is falling down seven times but getting up eight times.
    </p><p>
      Our son Hyung Jin has termed it the "seven deaths and resurrections." Who resurrected? Was it Adam and Eve's family? No. It was the father and mother -- the king of kings, the father and mother of all parents, the father and mother of tradition, the father and mother of lineage, the father and mother of resemblance [to God].

      I want to go now to where I discovered God's will and cried deeply as a young boy. I long for that place. When that person who had held on to a tree and wept bitterly because no one understood his circumstances went back to that place again, the tree and everything else was gone. I should return and rebuild it in its original form. Anyone capable of rebuilding it should follow me, follow the footsteps of a man who is over a hundred years old. The young people should shed tears of gratitude and move forward. Only then can the homeland that can liberate me revive. It has not revived, yet it can begin to revive.
    </p><p/><p>
      I go with that hope in mind. Yet, you can actually live in that world. Do you understand? I am slow and do not know how many more months I shall last. I may pass away and be gone, but I shall entrust that world, which I have lived in, to you and turn the suffering of my younger years into blessings. My only wish is that your descendants become ancestors that can bequeath to someone the things that I was unable to completely pass on to my children and descendants. I have no other wish. That is my only desire.

      If you have possessions, you should feel ashamed. I do not even have a wristwatch or ring. I have nothing. Here I am, the so-called founder of a religious group, sitting with Mother. But do I have a watch? The clothes I wear are the cheapest kind, bought in a department store and all made of nylon. They are nylon, not wool. I wear suits that cost under a hundred dollars. I should buy you all a thousand dollar suit when you receive the blessing. I have given out many of my things. I have distributed much of what I had. I have nothing, not even clothes.

      "I have been fighting alone on a worldwide level. I have no friends, no colleagues, and no parents. In the spirit world, the God of Night and the God of Day have been separated. On earth, Adam and Eve, brother and sister, were told by God, the Creator, not to eat the fruits of the tree of good and evil, but that has remained unaccomplished. Then what does the restoration through indemnity mean? If humans remain in normal blood for a thousand years, there will be no term 'restoration through indemnity.' The term 'providence of salvation shouldn't exist. The fight between good and evil should be gone.

      When I was catching fish, I moved my body, and I was stung by the <font face="Gulim, sans-serif"><span lang="zxx">????</span></font>(Gae Yeon thorns) and swollen and formed pus over the night. When I saw my body in the mirror, I found my body was full of pus. When I scratched, the blood flew from my chest down to legs, and then when I looked over the mountain, the hot smoke appeared from the summit there. Then it surrounded me, and it went up to the sky riding on the clouds, which I thought <b>symbolized the Feast of the Lamb of 144,000 in the air</b>.

      As well as the average of seven to eight hours of teaching every day in Hoon Dok Hae, True Father teaches in public and private meetings and even onboard boats, where he also offers all-night fishing conditions. To use every second that passes, he even teaches about the essence of the providence to the few followers that travel with him in his car. Regardless of whether his audience is ten thousand people, ten people or even two or three, he educates those around him at every opportunity.
    </p><p/><p>
      Sometimes he gives vent to the irritation he feels at having to teach such bat-blind, ignorant people, but he repeatedly attempts to implant the gist of his teachings deep in our hearts. With a serious expression on his face, he tells us that he needs to arrange everything while his body is still moving, because only then can all problems be easily resolved and our future be bright. If we tried to resolve all the problems and lay the foundation without him, he says, we could not finish the work in a thousand years.

<p>
      For three days from 3.22 to 3.24 [April 12-14, 2012], True Father went out to Temple Bay on Lake Mead with a small number of church leaders as an all-night fishing condition. The nights on Lake Mead are cold and chilly. To make matters worse, when it is windy and raining, it feels eerie and one cannot help but cower down. We do our best to cover True Father up from head to toe with sleeping bags and tuck him up tightly so no wind can find its way inside, and to block the winds and the rain with umbrellas, but as the night grows long, it becomes colder and colder.
    </p><p>
      While we are waiting for a fish to be caught on one of the lines cast into the water, True Father speaks to us on the boat or listens to reports. He changes the atmosphere on the boat, and worldly thoughts about the cold and other mundane things vanish in an instant. Mostly, he catches carp, catfish or bass. When a big fish is caught, we take photographs with Father. Sometimes we pose for individual photographs with Father, who says that we should remember that moment for all eternity.
    </p><p/><p>
      We were returned to Cheon Hwa Gung, where True Parents reside in Las Vegas at around four in the morning. Father never misses a Hoon Dok Hae session and continues to offer other devotions. When you consider his age, it is altogether unimaginable.
    </p><p/><p>
      Father continues to visit dark, low and vulgar places and voluntarily follows the path of a pioneer and a living offering. Why does he do that? He has to continue with such struggles because he has to complete even the unfulfilled responsibilities of the chosen children for the liberation of God and the salvation of humanity. It seems as if the sounds you hear in the lonely and almost silent surroundings -- the wind blowing, the waves lapping the shore, and an occasional cry made by animals -- reflect True Parents' heart.

      The origin of creation was the logic of "<b>living for the sake of others</b>" centered upon love. <b>Greatness is determined by how much you invest yourself for the sake of your object partner</b>. Here you can derive your life philosophy. Love can be reached through ideal voyage across the seas. In order for you to live purposefully toward your ideal destination, you need this life philosophy of living for the sake of others. <b>Unless you live your life by totally giving yourself, you will not able to meet the path of true love. It is only possible when you invest yourself totally and completely live for the sake of others</b>. You must make all these ideas as your foundation for your logic and philosophy of life.

Development can mean renaissance. Then it will bring prosperity and finally reach the Heavenly Kingdom.

      "Today is the special day when the proclamation of the restoration of God's fatherland must be substantially done. It is because the person who was ex-president of UTS (Dr. David Sang Chul Kim) passed away at an age of 97. Everything has been done centering on this day. As Jun Ho Seuk prayed, today is the 61st anniversary of my liberation of Heung Nam labor camp. (Then Father read his calligraphy given to Dr. Kim). I must open the door for him in the spirit world. "<b>Congratulations! The establishment of the Fatherland</b>, centering on True Parents." It is True Parents that said "The establishment of the Fatherland" for the first time. "Representative of loyalty and filial piety." "Entering the Garden." It is the first time to use the word ___.
    </p><p/><p>
      Hyoyul (Dr. Peter Kim)! Do you know how important the message that I have given for the past three days is? ('Yes.') Those who were Blessed or passed away during this period when I proclaimed the inheritance of heavenly fortune, can stand on that foundation. He (Dr. David Sang Chul Kim) was originally a member of the Anglican Church and when I was founding HSA-UWC, <b>he was in the position of the representative of Christianity</b>. Those who were with me in those days are all gone. Mother was not there yet, Hyoyul (Dr. Peter Kim) was not there either. (Regarding HSA-UWC) Unification of World Christianity by what? Not centering on humans but by God's spirit. Then who is the owner of the Association? It is True Parents who are not fallen.
    </p><p/><p>
      For the past three days, I gave a very important message. Do you know that Hyoyul? ('Yes.') He passed away on that foundation at his age of 97. The 14th day of the 10th month are not odd numbers. What a scary day today is. Now it all depends on whether or not you accept my message. His wife is an amazing woman, who gave an education to her husband behind the scenes when he made a mistake in attending to me. Entering the Garden can't be done by oneself and one must have family."

      "Nobody can interpret my message (calligraphy) for David Sang Chul Kim (who passed away recently).  If it is Person of loyalty and filial piety he is above me. There are many people who are loyal and filial but he is representative of such people. If I mistakenly write it, the whole world becomes upside down. For almost four hours in front of the paper I was thinking of all the Chinese characters I knew to write for him. <b>He is the only person who came to me and helped me establish HSA-UWC</b>(Holy Spirit Association for Unification of World Christianity)."

      Who are my sons and daughter? Bo-hi Pak! [Yes.] Are you my son, daughter, friend or disciple? [I am your son.] [Laughter] How are you my son? You say you're my son, but you don't resemble me in any way. If we were to be analyzed in a hundred, a thousand ways, there may or may not be a single way in which you resemble me, so how can you say you're my son? When we say the word "son," we could say that the son is someone we may lose in a remote area. That seems more plausible. A remote son may be lost in a remote place. Only when I can shed tears knowing he is lost can I say that the lost son is my son. I did not know this before I shed tears but came to realize it when I wept for him. You cannot know this until you have passed through such a crisis.
    </p><p/><p>
      So, how long have you been my son? [I have been your son my whole life.] [Laughter] What, what did you say now? Once? [My whole life.] For a week? [For my whole life.] For your whole life? I don't like that! [Laughter] I don't think I qualify to take care of such a son. I must serve him.
    </p><p>
      It is more comfortable to attend such a son. What is the position of serving one's son like?

      Col. [Bo Hi] Pak's family made a very serious mistake. There was supposed to be a Palace that was to be built. He sold the property without letting me know. Then France, Italy and Germany were in trouble because of this. The Grand Mufti of Syria then came forward and supported True Father. There was a promise made to me that was broken. Did you know about that?

      The most difficult problem here has been between the Pak family and the Moon family. My original name was Yong Sung Moon. Bo Hi Pak's name means that he came in to True Parents as an ordinary person.

      I have never thought of you separately as Japanese people. I think about you first. There are more of you than the Koreans. When I think about you, all Japanese people have the Mongolian birthmark. Eighty-four percent of the human race, including those already in the spirit world, have this birthmark and are siblings. The father of our fathers, in other words, God, is the one who seeks to see these relationships. God does not have a place in this world. Who is the cause of this?

      Through True Parents coming here to Nigeria, today for the first time this lady could be called the best of the Unification Church and someone who can remain in the mission history together with True Parents.

      So many people came to and left the Unification Church. Thousands and thousands of people left. They later tried to oppose our church substituting their race and nation through the representatives of the ruling and opposition parties. They wanted us to disappear, hoping our church would disappear within 10 years. But 10 years later, they found that we were advanced connecting all layers of the world while they found themselves living in a separate world. We are now in the time when we discuss the unification of the cosmos. They will say I am lying but I won't give any excuses. You wait and see.

      Three of these grandchildren were in the Sikorsky Helicopter Accident. The "three musketeers" (the three grandchildren) were not hurt. Shin Jun Nim cried out for King Daddy, King Daddy. 
    </p><p/><p>
      Because I exercised I could make it. I was hanging upside down. I couldn't pull myself up or otherwise the seat belt couldn't be unfastened. It was a miracle that it didn't catch fire. After we got out then it caught fire.  True Mother could have easily died. The trees all could have caught on fire. The pine branch that pierced the cabin had come close to True Mother's leg. We all survived.  One special safety feature of this helicopter was that the gas tank did not explode.

      There were 13 people on the helicopter when it crashed and everyone survived. This was a victory for God.

      "When we had the helicopter incident, mother and I heard Shin Jun (and other True grandchildren) calling 'King Father, King Mother, King Father, King Mother', and we thought we couldn't die there. When I heard they were calling, I thought <b>we must escape from the helicopter within <font size="5">17 minutes</font></b> (before it burns) otherwise they would die."
    </p><p/><p>
      Then Father explained in detail how he could come out from the helicopter. (When his upper body came out from it) "I thought I would survive. Heaven protected me. Then I shouted 'Ya, King Father and King Mother are here!' Then they said 'King Father and King Mother, we will be with you and please wait a second!" Then Father explained the technical advantage of the helicopter that blocked passengers' room from fire in the beginning. "Nobody shed blood and no clothes were torn. Such a outcome had never happened in the history of aircraft accidents."
    </p><p>
      Then Father told True grandchildren to sing Grandmother Flower several times, which Father let the children sang right after the incidents to encourage themselves. The following are the lyrics and the English translation of the song.
    </p><p/><p>
      Grandmother flower on the back hill, grandmother flower with thorns,
    </p><p>
      were you old from when you sprouted, grandmother flower with hoary hair?
    </p><p>
      You could have chosen from tens of millions of different flowers,
    </p><p>
      why choose to be a thorny and stooped grandmother flower?
    </p><p>
      Hahahaha, you are funny, you stooped grandmother flower!

<p>
      Rev. Chang Shik Yang's report:
    </p><p/><p>
      "I came from Las Vegas together with Rev. Ki Hun Kim. Rev. Jeong Ok Yu has been focused on educating 3,000 ministers in the US by the end of this year, and within one year, we have a plan to educate 7,000 to 12,000 people. By the day before yesterday, we finished educating 18,000 people. In the east we have seminars in the Atlantic city, NJ, which is also a casino city, and in the west we have them in Las Vegas. In a casino city, there are lots of hotels and convention centers, as such, if we avoid busy time, we can find hotel rooms with very economic prices like $50 a night. Meals offered at those hotels are great, which is often buffet style.
    </p><p>
      We have 400 to 700 participants at each seminar.
    </p><p/><p>
      This time the seminar was special, where our members and ministers they knew joined together. The seminar was focused on educating ministers where our members can learn how to introduce the principle and True Parents to ministers. Originally True Father went to the US to revive Christianity and with Christian leaders he wanted to restructure the UN.
    </p><p/><p>
      During Father's ministry in the US, Father mainly spoke of the essence of the ideal of creation, human fall and the restoration in his speech with a well organized way. There are many great speeches regarding the future of Christianity, the US, UN, etc. By watching video clips and reading Father's speech, ministers came to understand more about Father whom they believed knows what Christianity is, who Jesus is and what God expects the US to do.
    </p><p/><p>
      We started the education regarding the Original Substance of the Principle in Las Vegas, but from now until early next year, many conventions will take place there and therefore 170,000 hotel rooms in Las Vegas are almost full every day, and 100,000 people arrive and leave at the airport every day. The room fee went up from $50 to $300 and that is why we need to have it in the east, in Atlantic city where people easily can drive to. Father has worked in the east mainly in Washington DC and New York as such, we have more minister contacts there, and the Atlantic city is located in the middle.
    </p><p>
      Father explained the details of God's ideal of creation, and that is the very weak point of Christian theologians, even if they are famous. It has been challenging for me and Rev. Kim to introduce the deep contents of the principle to the ministers.
    </p><p/><p>
      In 1982, Father established the International Christian Students Association (ICSA) at universities in Korea, which was called Christian CARP, in comparison to CARP. Dr. Song and myself gave lectures at ICSA and we gave full and detailed lectures to around 300 students before we brought them to Japan for further training -- in total we brought 3,000 Christians to Japan -- but one third left during the lectures, they said they wouldn't go to Japan. Some of them hid themselves in the closet and tried not to listen to the principle and said "'The more I listen, the more I become confused." When we went to Father to make a report on this and asked him if we can bring them to Japan first and then educate them.' I still remember vividly what said to us at that time. Father said 'The principle itself is not the problem, but how to convey that is the problem.' I felt as if I was hit by a hammer. It didn't work to give the same lecture to Christian students that we gave to our members, and we changed the workshop title from the "Divine Principle Workshop" to "Jesus hung on the Cross." We also gave Divine Principle lectures in all sections connecting them with Jesus and the cross, which are the key words of Christianity. Then we found that they started to open their minds. The power of the principle is great and if they accept it, they can live and be resurrected but if they refuse it, they die spiritually right there.
    </p><p>
      As of now we have had three occasions of intensively educating Christian ministers: At the time of Father's imprisonment at Danbury when 7,000 Christian ministers visited Korea, the education of 5,000 ministers occurred in Washington DC in 1995, and this time with the workshop of the Original Substance of the Divine Principle.
    </p><p/><p>
      After a couple of seminars of the OSDP, we realized merely less than one third of the contents is conveyed through the interpreter, and with Father's blessing, Rev. Yu now gives the lecture only on the ideal of creation and the American lecturers do the rest. Bishop Jesse Edwards and Archbishop Stallings, are co-presidents of the ACLC and Father calls them twins even though they are white and black respectively. The two of them are the ones who give lectures and testify to True Parents.
    </p><p/><p>
      In the lecture, it is clearly said that Korea is God's homeland. In the past, people in the US did not respect Koreans but they did so to the Japanese. Recently however Korean culture, especially Korean pop songs have become more popular in the world, and I think it is providential.
    </p><p>
      I always start my lecture with Matthew 10:18, and we also show more than 500 photos which testify Father's achievement. I believe the participants understand the origin by seeing its fruits. I say in my lecture that if Jesus comes back here again, what would he do? That is exactly what Father has been doing. I also say that if they know of a greater leader than Father, I want to know and follow him. There is always nobody who dares to say they know somebody better than Father.
    </p><p/><p>
      Father told 172 ministers, who visited Korea for two weeks for their registration to Korea, to bring 12 ministers each to the workshop. That makes 2064 ministers, and Father, before leaving for Korea, told us to educate totally 3,000 ministers. All 172 ministers, after coming back from Korea, held assemblies to report their experiences to their congregations. They were all proud of receiving Korean family names saying that they have become a part of Rev. Moon's family. As I said, we are currently holding the workshops in two cities, but soon we will have smaller-sized workshops where they want to have them and our lecturers will go there to give education so that we can reach our goal of educating 120,000 people.
    </p><p/><p>
      Through my experience, I re-found the power of the truth and of the principle. We should not be used to knowing the principle. I also believe that Father's words given at Hoon Dok Hae have become the bones and flesh of those Christian leaders and give them a right sense of direction. I deeply thank True Parents."

      Only when you voluntarily take the path that other people can't, though you don't like it yourself, God's Will will be realized after you and the angelic world will protect you. Without going through that process, there will never be liberation and victory for you. If you clearly understand it, you should carry through embracing such an idea until the end of your life.

      They were told, "If you eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you will surely die." We need to go beyond that level. The <b>conjugal standard</b>, which was destroyed when evil parents came into existence, <b>was restored through indemnity</b>. Through this, parents that had been evil are restored to have the authority of true parents.<b> Entities divided, such as the God of Night and the God of Day, Cain and Abel, and heaven and earth, are being restored to their original state </b>based on the understanding that if you eat of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil, you will surely die.

      Do you know that I sat and rode on the back of China, Japan, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States and France and declared the movement to breaking through at the grassroots level (tong-ban gyeokpa)? Who can break through at the grassroots level? The Federation for Victory over Communism defeated communism. Rather than branding the enemy as the enemy and burying it, the world of the enemy -- the Devil, Satan -- was brought to<b> complete submission and liberated </b>on March 21, 1999.

      Now on the national level, you should work hard to put the world in good order, such as Adam and Jesus were unable to do. Israel, the chosen people, lost their country and you have not found your country yet. <b>From the most spiritually developed country's standard, I got rid of all the persecution and brought about the surrender of Satan. Satan is defeated, and the one unified realm of God on the family level has been established</b>, so we have to bring God's country up to the world level based on the national level (that was accomplished) at the time of Jesus, who had paid indemnity for the fallen people of Israel. So, what matters the most to you now? Those of you who received the three blessings in front of God are in the position of His children. Your families are supposed to fulfill their responsibilities as the third creators.

      I was finished with everything. Do you understand? From now on it is your responsibility. (Showing his arms) <b>The hair on my arms was all gone yesterday and black hair is growing.

      Theologians and atheists should gather together and debate until issues are resolved. Be honest, ISM's that deny God will be discarded. Have a clear mind. When an order is given a soldier must act. I have given the order so you must act. Will you serve True Parents? Things are 97% complete so we just need to complete the remaining 3%. You must take part in the coming celebrations and the Registration for Gods Kingdom and Fatherland.

      We are passing through a new age. Therefore, the spirit world is also changing. Just wait and see.... The True Parent will speak to all of you standing here. Now you have to adjust your life. You must teach your children. The Heavenly Parent and the True Parents on earth... I am the True Parent who has united mind and body. There is the Creator who is the great master of heaven and earth and there are True Parents. Since Adam and Eve did not become the True Parents, everything was broken apart. The True Parents have now entered the age when everything can be completed -- the time of regaining. Please be aware and believe that the foundation for new life and resurrection has arrived in the universe. The families of those of you who maintain that faith will be blessed....
    </p><p/><p>
      The original creator of the spirit body and spirit mind completed everything in the Garden of Eden and told Adam's family that the one who ate of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil would surely die. We have gotten beyond that age. Now that you are in the realm of such influence, please live with one heart and keep in your heart what I am saying to you now.
    </p><p/><p>
      We enter the age when you will be able to experience firsthand and know that what I say is being fulfilled. This is <b>the age when your mind and body will be able to frequent places of another, higher dimension, different from that of the past</b>. So, you should become families that are humble and can be entitled to this grace. It is time for you to fulfill this. True Parents are aligning everything that has been divided -- heaven and earth, the God of Night and the God of Day -- in one direction at this time.

      Children's Day was declared on the 1st day of the 10th month of 1960 on the lunar calendar (November
    </p><p>
      19, 1960) at the former headquarters church at Cheong Pa Dong, Yong San Gu, Seoul. Later on, at the
    </p><p>
      pledge ceremony of the 35th Parents' Day in 1994, True Parents decreed that the word  True be placed before the names of the Four Major Holy Days, and thenceforth the day has been observed as True Children s Day.
    </p><p>
               
    </p><p>
      The first celebration for Children's Day, held under the title of Thanksgiving Day service, was personally carried out from beginning to end by True Parents, and in his words True Father stated:  This Thanksgiving Day we are celebrating is truly the festive day of heaven eagerly awaited by God for six thousand years since the creation and the onset of human history. Henceforth, the 1st day of the 3rd month and 1st day of the 10th month on the lunar calendar will be celebrated every year as an importan festive day. In particular, today marks the day of the children and the season of fruition.

<p>
      The Day of the Victory of Love is the Day when True Parents' love overcame the death of Heung Jin Nim (mN: <span>???</span>  ), sending him as the general to the spirit world. This could happen through the amazing love of True Parents shown during the period and especially at the hospital and Heung Jin Nim's behavior at the moment of the accident.
    </p><p/><p>
      Details
    </p><p><a href="http://www.tparents.org/Moon-Talks/SunMyungMoon12/SunMyungMoon-120124b.htm">http://www.tparents.org/Moon-Talks/SunMyungMoon12/SunMyungMoon-120124b.htm </a></p><p><a href="http://www.tparents.org/Moon-Talks/SunMyungMoon12/SunMyungMoon-120124b.htm"/></p><p>
      So, on December, 1983, the Victory of Communism Events were held in 8 cities in Korea. The last Event was when He was in Kwanju in Korea. Heung Jin Nim was in America at the time. Heung Jin Nim had gotten special permission from Mother to fix the motor cycle, which was in UTS. He had gotten permission to go to UTS; so, He had taken two 2nd generation with Him. On His way back He got into the accident. It was December; so, the ground was frozen and this truck was coming very fast and it was slipping. It was about to have a head-on collision. If Heung Jin Nim had turned the steering wheel to the left, He would have probably survived the accident. However, He wanted to protect Jin Bok and Jin Gil, the two 2nd generation who were with him. So, Heung Jin Nim deliberately turned the steering wheel to the right and Jin Bok and Jin Gil did not get hurt at all; but Heung Jin Nim was very hurt through that and was seriously, critically injured through that accident.
    </p><p/><p>
      Heung Jin Nim entered a coma at that time and was entered into the St. Francis Hospital. I was there at the time. So, it was a time when I was able to meet True Parents at that hospital. So, after I met True Parents who had completed their tour in Korea, Father came to America. Father thanked Heung Jin Nim for sacrificing himself on Father's behalf; and, He made a determination to send Heung Jin Nim to the spirit world and held a Unification Ceremony at the hospital. The Unification Ceremony was a time where Father was setting a condition of becoming One With God instead of in all ways being so sad about Heung Jin Nim's dying. Also, Mother, Instead of being so sad about Heung Jin Nim's death, She set a condition of becoming One with Father and set a standard of Love of God and Father (and a Highest Level Connection was made with Heung Jin Nim Spiritually) Also, brothers and sisters of Heung Jin Nim, instead of being so sad about Heung Jin Nim's death, They were coming to have greater Love for True Parents. Also, the Blessed Families made a dedication of, instead of being so sad about Heung Jin Nim's death, they had a time of becoming one with True Parents. That was a time when all the religions of the world to become one with The Unification Church on that occasion as well.
    </p><p/><p>
      So, that is, as Father was talking about, <b>how to have victory over death through Love</b>. So this is talking about Father's Absolute Love toward God and True Mother's Absolute Love toward Father overcoming Heung Jin Nim's death. So, Heung Jin Nim's Absolute True Love toward True Parents and Heung Jin Nim's True Love toward His friends brought Victory over death at that time. <b>So, it was through this Day of Victory of Love that it was possible, through the Unification Ceremony, for the Seunghwa Ceremony to appear, which is the Seong Hwa Ceremony.</b>  <b>So, Seong Hwa Ceremony is a time of new joy when people can be graced by God; and, it is a time where our life on earth has just moved on to the spirit world.</b></p><p/><p>
      So, Heung Jin Nim's Devotion and Love for True Parents did not end at this point. Heung Jin Nim was appointed as the Commanding Chief of the spirit world by Father, and during the eighteen-year period until 1987, the greatest Devotion was given. So, before this Foundation was given through Heung Jin Nim on the earth and when this Foundation was given to Heung Jin Nim to do His work in the spirit world. So, in this way The Day of Victory of Love was proclaimed and the Seong Hwa Grace has been given to us by True Parents. So, let's give a big round of applause for gratitude to our True Parents.
    </p><p/><p><b>Heung Jin Nim went to the Position of Being The Elder Brother of Jesus. So, in this way, it was possible for Jesus to have Parents (mN:since Hueng Jin Nim is Jesus' elder, naturally TP is Jesus parents).</b> <b>In the past there was no Parents of Jesus; so, that is why there were no Blessings in the past.</b> But, through connecting Heung Jin Nim to the spirit world, Heung Jin Nim went to the Position of the Older Brother of Jesus; and, True Parents have been able to get that Position up until now; so, the Age of The True Parents of Heaven and Earth and Humankind will pass. Centering on the Tradition of the True Parents of Heaven, Earth and Humankind you need to resemble; and, follow Their Tradition. If you do not, you cannot go to Heaven. So, in the Position of Parents, you need to teach your 2nd and 3rd generations True Parents Tradition. If you do not teach The Tradition, they cannot go to Heaven. This is not some kind of joke. True Parents have shed Blood, Sweat and Tears; and, Nose Water, Mouth Water and Ear Water. These four kinds of waters are connected. That is what is connected to the Unification Ceremony, which we will discuss today.

You should all understand everything you hear in my speech today. These are such important times, but you have lived in ignorance for decades. For twenty-eight years, you lived without understanding these things. During this time, you stole, and the mothers and fathers [of the world] brought things down.

      In 2001 the Coronation for God's Kingship could be realized and Cheon Il Guk was established. This began the 12 year course. Then in 2003, the Coronation of True Parents was held on the family level. Then, the Coronation of the King of Peace occurred on the Global scale.

<p>
      Through the 8 stage course Father had to reestablish the path back to God through the blessing which must be secured through Absolute Faith, Absolute Love and Absolute Obedience. Basically, Father has been giving the blessing as the central mission -- three couples was first, then 36, then on to 3.6 million and 36 million combined at Robert F. Kennedy stadium (RFK in Washington, D.C) and then 360 million couples. The RFK blessing was a tremendous battle -- centering on the second Israel. After that victory the blessing was much easier to give.
    </p><p/><p>
      On this foundation the blessing could then be given in the spirit world, with Heung Jin nim (spirit world) guiding. When ancestors are blessed, they come under the dominion of God. This foundation allows them to become absolute good spirits.
    </p><p/><p>
      1989 in Kodiak was the Pal Jung Shik. In that way, our True Parents laid the foundation to realize the fulfillment of the 8 stages both horizontally and vertically. On the next day Father could establish the Declaration Day for Heavenly Parentism -- resolving all Cain and Abel issues.

      This spiritual condition made it possible for the collapse of the Soviet Union. Just after this declaration, Communism did fall. In 1999 IIFWP was created, then in 2005 UPF was created. In the Manhattan Center 194 flags of nations were exalted in the creation of the Abel UN.

      (Katsumi: Father marked with circles these words and wrote "IMPORTANT.'")
    </p><p>
      "This is important." Ladies and gentlemen, last year in Las Vegas, there was a special proclamation centered on God that was given by the True Parents of Heaven, Earth and Humankind on two separate days -- one part at 2:20 AM on the 8th day of the 5th month of the Heavenly Calendar (June 19, 2010) and the other at 3:25 AM, on the 15th day of the 5th month of the Heavenly Calendar (June 26, 2010).
    </p><p/><p>
      "You don't know what the proclamations were."

      Special proclamation centered on God that was given by the True Parents of Heaven, Earth and Humankind on two separate days -- one part at 2:20 AM on the 8th day of the 5th month of the Heavenly Calendar (June 19, 2010) and the other at 3:25 AM, on the 15th day of the 5th month of the Heavenly Calendar (June 26, 2010).

      The number 3 from 3:25 AM represents the three eras from the saying "Success comes at the third attempt." It also symbolizes the Old, New and Completed Testament ages. Twenty-five minutes, or the number 25, is a quarter of one hundred. The True Parents have achieved ultimate unity and offered and proclaimed the era of God's full transcendence, full immanence, full authority and omnipotence upon the standard of perfection, completion and conclusion.

      The proclamation this year(2011) was made at the <b>51st anniversary</b>  (2011-1960) of True Parents' Holy Wedding, so it was proclaimed in the position of overcoming the number 50. As Father says in his speech, "I am leading a lifestyle befitting the era after the coming of heaven,"<b>  the proclamation this time means that the victorious lifestyle of the Era After the Coming of Heaven will be expanded</b>. In other words, it means the proclamation of the conclusion of the Era After the Coming of Heaven. <b>Therefore, through the proclamation, the rapid cleansing of the sinful world will happen, and if we fulfill our responsibility through our practice</b>, God's foundation will be dynamically established in an unimaginable speed and scale. We have entered into such an age. Then, let's think of our attitude in this age.

      The things I talk about dating back 70 years are the content you need to know. There is no need to talk about its merits or demerits.

This is a compilation of my speeches Do you have this in your home? Well? How many volumes do you have? Eh? <b>I don't think you have the speech given at the Cosmic Assembly for the Settlement of the True Parents of Heaven and Earth and Humankind and for the Proclamation of the Word of God's Substantial Self</b>. I had intended to give this on the occasion. We have tens of thousands of copies stacked in a large storage house. I hand these out when I go. Do not give it to those who are not here. I have made all of these already. They are all here. Are those who buy all the volumes of my sermons loyal servants of Rev. Moon? Can they become my children?

      (Opening page 74 of his speech file) "Page 74 contains everything. You do not know what it says here. (Katsumi: the speech file the participants at ODP receive has 73 pages and Father recently added one more page to that.) The first thing is Perfection, Completion, and Conclusion. These are the ultimate purpose of God's providence. Then it says 'Eog Mansei,' which has the same value to it (which is 'Perfection, Completion, and Conclusion). Then it says Conclusion of the Reign of Tranquility and Prosperity. You do not know what Reign of Tranquility and Prosperity means. Hyung Jin said True Parents Eog Mansei. But where do True Parents remain? In the air? It should be In the Reign of Tranquility and Prosperity, True Parents Eog Mansei.

      God's heart has been in pain throughout history because humanity has been confined under Satan's dominion. Humanity had endured oppression under the sovereignty of evil throughout the "era before the coming of heaven."<b> That time has finally come to an end! 2007 was the zenith at which time it became possible for the gates to open wide to the revolutionary era after the coming of heaven</b>, ushering in the time of a new sovereignty of goodness in which humanity could serve and attend God as the central being.

      ) for the new world. It is a strictly regulated rite performed on the national level. We have the Seunghwa Ceremony ???,  but that is something performed after death. You need to know that from the moment you hear about these, you have the responsibility as parents to raise children who will go to the kingdom of heaven. The two ceremonies are different.
    </p><p>
      The Chinese character for seong <font face="Tahoma" size="medium">?</font>  in seonghwa contains the character for yi "ear" and the character for gu "mouth."

      "There isn't a day when I did not speak and in my collected speeches there are all days and months as the date when the speeches were given. You, in the position of the Tribal Messiah, started to read my speech book and there will be a problem if you and your tribe can't establish a nation before you and they are finished with reading them all. Such a competition will start now. There are 387 nations (194 Abel UN nations and 193 Cain UN nations), and thousands of tribal leaders and millions of people will start to read my speech books. <b>If they want to make their tribe special in the spirit world, they must consider my speech books their own and get started from the date of the speech that moved them</b>.
    </p><p/><p>
      (For example) Today we read my speech titled "Life and Results from the speech book # 33. When you are determined with this speech and your descendants continue to read my speech, you will be the ancestor who has such a standard (of the contents of the speech). I don't know if it is OK to talk about this here. The new tribe will start. For millions of years and eternity, the words given under the name of True Parents will never disappear. <b>In your life, it is a starting point when you are moved by my speech given on a specific day included in a specific speech book</b>, and your tribe continues to read my speeches and there will be a competition of how many times each tribe has read them. Be determined now and start when you go back home, and (if you are successful in doing this) you can even go in front of the God of Night and the God of Day. This is unbelievable grace. The Cheon Bok Gung has such a meaning.

You need to feel that you can transfer yourself to the original world, an amazing world beyond imagination, after receiving the Blessing together with (True) parents. The Royal seal of parents has been made, and <b>if you pray for yourself to be united with my words every morning with the photo of the seal, Satan will be completely kicked out</b>."

      (Opening the page <b>33</b> of his speech file) When you see <b>page 33</b>, it says, All people of the Christian faith recognize that God sent His true son Jesus Christ to earth two thousand years ago to save humankind. However, Jesus suffered a miserable fate. The leaders of Judaism and the people of Israel were supposed to receive Jesus as the Messiah and follow him with absolute faith, absolute love and absolute obedience. They should never have allowed Jesus' crucifixion to take place. He suddenly left this world, leaving behind the words, "It is finished." This is an amazing statement.
    </p><p/><p>
      Yet these words apply to spiritual salvation only, and he promised to return. Ladies and gentlemen, God quietly raised and prepared the Korean people over a period of thousands of years. After two thousand years of preparation, His labor has finally borne fruit with the Second Coming of Christ on the far distant Korean Peninsula. I realized this when I was <b>33</b>  years old. The spirit of that age is vigorous and think how such a young man became earnest for the nation that is perishing. You can read of such circumstances on this page.

      The Path Humankind Should Take: Distinguished Guests, your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen. The path that humanity must now take is clear. What would give you cause to hesitate in the face of D-Day? That Heaven has revealed through us, the True Parents? There are now only six hundred days remaining. Only 600 days left and what kind of heart do you think I have? Read this speech as reference for that. This is page 39 and so I was before 40 years old then. Descendants of the Goguryo dynasty that dominated the region for 1,000 years can't disappear. You should think of that. Heaven's blessings will be with you on your ambitious and busy course. Unless I die, I must spread the blessing.

      If you view the flow of history through eyes that focus on God's providence, you can see that the changes of the times can be broadly classified into three stages. First was the nature-centered era, a time when instinctual feelings, materialism and a closeness to animals and the things of creation were prevalent. In life, one must have Jeong (emotion or love).
    </p><p/><p>
      Next came a human-centered era. when people's knowledge, feelings and emotions took precedence and dominated the world. However, these eras were transitional. They were courses of preparation necessary in order to enter the era in which people could rid themselves of their fallen nature, return to their original selves and live as one united family where they attend God as their father. When that happens we will enter a God-centered era, the final stage in which human beings who know and feel God's Heart and Will follow the path of living for the sake of others. I realized this when I was 40 <b>(looking at the numbering of the page which is 40).</b></p></a> <a href="http://www.tparents.org/Moon-Talks/SunMyungMoon11/SunMyungMoon-111026.htm"><img src="hdh2010-2012.html_files/ilink.png" alt="User Link" style="border-width:0"/></a></div></li></ul></li>

      Once the actual era of Cheon Il Guk begins, the spiritual and earthly worlds will be connected and brought into oneness, and all things will be governed under the Union of the Spiritual and Physical Worlds Association, which will be established on earth for the first time. <b>To have God is not enough.

      On page 74, it says, 'The providential purpose is done.' 'The Perfected Era of the Providence,' means everything has been done. Therefore when it says 'Eog Mansei,' we can say 'Eog Mansei. Then 'perfection, completion and conclusion' as the formation, growth and perfection stages. Not just ___ it should be In the Reign of Tranquility and Prosperity, True Parents Eog Mansei! And it says ' The Reign of Tranquility and Prosperity is concluded.' There is no completion, (perfection) for that term.

      (Indicating his latest speech) "This is the record of my life from the year one to my age of 73. I numbered 74 on the sheet by myself which has the conclusion.

The title of this page is '<font face="Gulim, sans-serif">?????????</font>(Final purpose of the providence is accomplished).' It says '1. Perfection.' Adam's family must have been perfected. Adam ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and became a false parent instead of becoming a True Parent. Then it says '2. Conclusion,' and '3. Completion.'"

<p>
      By having the holy wedding ceremony of perfected True Parents when I become 93 years old (in year 2013) and mother becomes 70 years old, we will enter the era in which True Parents will go with all (the Blessed) families heading for a perfected heaven and earth.
    </p><p/><p>
      Our birthday next year will be for this wedding ceremony. Fallen parents (Adam and Eve), without accomplishing their responsibility, messed around with everything in heaven and earth, but by having the wedding ceremony when True Parents can proclaim their perfection, we need to re-establish the standard of liberating the nation centering on 36 couples, 72 couples, 124 couples, and 430 couples, and call all the Blessed families (to Korea).
    </p><p/><p>
      This time, (True) Parents, who have been through individual, familial, tribal, racial, national, and worldwide levels, will receive the Blessing without a shadow of the fall. It will take place on the birthday of my 93 years and mother's 70 years, and we will go enter the era when (True) Parents have absolute authority over heaven and earth.
    </p><p/><p>
      Without taking responsibility for your own tribe after (True) Parents' wedding ceremony, your path will be the same as fallen descendants. Inheriting (True) Parents' tradition and blood lineage makes you resemble (True) Parents.

      Think about it based on the Principle. Did sons and daughters exist before True Parents? No. 1 Whose sons and daughters are you? Are you True Parents' sons and daughters? Are you the sons and daughters of God, of the God of Night and the God of Day? Well? Which is it? Where do you fit in? You are the archangel's sons and daughters. Once you have that answer, the Principle makes clear sense. Asking or answering any more questions is unnecessary. You have to pay indemnity. If you don't know how to indemnify this, you cannot enter the kingdom of heaven. You need to clearly understand. <b>You need to cross thirteen stages</b>. You need to cross them with complete faith in me. It is all about absolute faith, absolute love and absolute obedience....

      Our D-Day is not far off. You know about D-Day, don't you?... I think we calculated it yesterday at something like a year and five months, or a year, four months and twenty-three days, to be precise. D-Day will soon be upon us. Do you know what will happen then? <b>Have True Parents ever been married?</b> Mother, have you ever had a wedding? [Mother: Formation, growth, completion....] Have we done all the ceremonies? All heaven and earth should know about the D-Day True Parents have designated, even those who have just woken up. Do you think anyone could sleep on True Parents wedding day? How about the fish in the water, do you think they will want to attend our wedding, or not? They will want to attend it.] Would the rats, pigs and even earthworms that live underground want to come to the wedding, or not? How about dogs, pigs, raccoons or badgers? How about all non-living things?

      How about raindrops and water? Rather than flow away, would water come and wait in stillness at the wedding? When you think about that, it is not fair. True Parents real wedding would be such an event that any form of being in the world, even dead and buried people with rotting bones and flesh, would want to come to attend it. Wouldn't you want to come too even if you were dead? Wouldn't you?

      There is no greater blessing than if I bless you on the same day at the same hour as True Parents' wedding. There is one lineage, not two. People should live together in joy. Neither up nor down, large nor small exist. Things are as they are. When you think about True Parents wedding, do you think they can marry while neglecting you who have been blessed? Who married True Parents? Where could you find such a principle or rule?
    </p><p/><p>
      In order to create a resting place for all of you, in order to search for the bride and groom, for Adam's family and a world that manifests Adam's will, which was lost in the Garden of Eden, a commemorative day of blessing for our brave soldiers will take place. On True Parents' wedding day, you will receive the blessing and clans will be registered, allowing them to enter heaven. You will be able to see that day of liberation. I'm talking about registration. Do you know what registration means? The nation will become different. The world will become different. By taking part in True Parents' holy wedding, you will be able to live under that banner of glory. This is a dream within a dream -- a time more precious than sitting on a throne surrounded by music, more precious than a congratulatory song for the blessing. You need to be aware of this.

      For the sake of that day, I shall give away my life, assets even hundreds of dollars to become a wanderer in this land. Finally I have to see the liberation of the hometown and homeland and have discovered that the Korea is God's hometown.

[445 days.] The question is how can we surmount that hill? Only by affirming that kind of heart and rising to that level can I fulfill God's will and my own desire. That summit atop of that great mountain of hope in the distance awaits me....

      The tradition has been prepared based on which the returning Lord can come and hold his Holy Wedding. Adam and Eve, who were driven out of the Garden of Eden because they broke the commandment that told them they would die if they ate the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil, <b>have now become one as the mature fruit and are now serving the God of Night, the God of Day, and the True Parent. With the great authority of the True Parents, they are attending the tree of life and the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden</b>.

      Until the God of Night and the God of Day, the Creator, blesses our families in the Garden of Eden and installs us there, the original royal territory of True Parents cannot be established. Everyone should receive the privilege of going directly to the kingdom of heaven at the same time, but you, who have received the blessing, have lived as you pleased.

      The day of True Parents' wedding ceremony is the day on which the registration of the birth of their sons and daughters is accomplished after they graduate from the satanic world. <b>I must receive the royal seal proving that you are True Parents' sons and daughters from God</b>, and must bequeath it to you, <b>but I haven't yet decided who should receive it....</b></p><p/><p>
      When Rev. Moon becomes the perfected True Parent, you too will earn the right to receive the royal seal, which will allow you to stand in the positions of the first and second generations of ancestors. After that, even newborn babies will go to the Kingdom of Heaven directly. Hell will be completely destroyed. Everything will be completely liberated and freed, and the Kingdom of Heaven alone will be our homeland.

      When a person on the individual level meets Christ and wants to go up to the familial level, they must pay an indemnity condition on earth. Likewise, those who are on the familial level and want to go up to the tribal level must go through an indemnity course. Consequently, I can say the longer one has been with the Unification church, the more they have paid indemnity conditions. This means the longer you have been with the church, the closer you are to me. Until reaching the national level, we go up vertically, and then we must establish a national structure. But until we reach such a level, we could experience falling down again and again. It is important how we can go beyond the national level and be settled.
    </p><p/><p>
      Since the Messiah knows how to indemnify history, even if people can't make indemnity conditions, if they are united with him, the indemnity period could be shortened. When a heavenly nation is settled together with the Messiah, you can imagine how fast the restoration of the whole world can take place. By only having a nation, we can go beyond the paradise level, which is like a waiting room prior to going to the kingdom of heaven. You must understand how important it is to have a nation.

      If you don't have a nation and go to the spirit world, through resurrection, you will be able to save individuals and families and can't receive aid from solid authority. In other words, you can't become a qualified person who can fight against Satan. When there is a nation, you can be registered. Have you been registered? <b>You have been registered to the Unification Church <font size="4">but couldn't do so to a nation yet</font></b>. Without having a nation, one can't become a citizen of the nation.
    </p><p/><p>
      Therefore, the wish of the people in the spirit world is to be able to help the people of the heavenly nation. Once we have such a nation, resurrection of the people of the spirit world can take place horizontally. That means when you make efforts, they will substantially remain eternally. However in the course of finding such a nation, even if one has made great efforts, everything will be gone when they make mistakes. That has actually been repeated in history. In the course of indemnity, everything has been gone, but after having a nation, all the effort people make will remain eternally as their results.
    </p><p/><p>
      Once we have a nation, we can have our ambassadors in all countries in the world. Once the Unification Church and Christianity are united, we will have the ambassadors, missionary centers, and our church members. Our ambassadors are in Abel's position and presidents and prime ministers in the countries are in Cain's position. When Abel's realm and Cain's realm become one, they form together one Abel realm. It is God that always helps the Abel realm, and we will be able to invite all the volunteers from the world to develop our nation."

When wild geese fly over the rivers and mountains holding one purpose, they support each other flying ahead and behind. Likewise, it is the way Heaven goes to make efforts and encourage each other without the disparity between strong and weak, to take the initiative in supporting and pulling the people who fell behind, and to become the foothold for anyone who can't go up higher."

      We are in the month of November. What's the title [of today's Hoon Dok speech]? "The Way of an Unificationist Believer." This is the way members of the Unification Church are to go, the path believers should follow. This is the way to go for people who live in the realm of God's word. To become Unificationist believers, to have your name included on the list of God's children, you must unite your mind and body. You must resemble [God].

      Unificationists are responsible for what the children of families in the Unificationist community believe, whether they are still in their mother's womb or have already been born and have grown up. They could have stood against you. Being centered on the body, an enemy might appear and everything be turned upside down. For that not to happen, I have offered my devotion today and brought us past that point.

      Father has said that there must be four palaces, and according to Professor Oh, these will represent the four directions, with True Parents at the center. The main Cheonjeong Palace in Chung Pyung represents East. This one in Geomun Island represents South. Two others, as yet unbuilt -- one in Seoul and one in Switzerland -- represent North and West respectively.

      The Ocean Cheonjeong Palace also represents a palace for the underwater world, which originally True Father had intended to establish in the Pantanal wetlands in South America. The center of the Ocean providence, however, has since moved (via Hawaii) to the Yeosu area. Professor Oh mentioned in particular that, as many have died at sea, this providence opens the way for those unhappy spirits to be liberated.

      This place could be the worst or the best place. When you come to like the worst place, it will become the best place for you. If a mediocre bad place becomes better, it only becomes a mediocre good place, but if you make the worst place becomes the best place, it means you pioneered the path that no other can't and that you came in the position of ownership. That is the only way where God would want you to lead the way with Him rather than just be amazed with and give applause to you. Even if you don't have food and can't do anything else, once you realize it, you should try it. Then until the results come, you could console Him as a friend, comrade, or in-law.

      Right after the meeting, True Parents left for the Peace Dam at Hwa Cheon. Father had said he must collect Jeong Seong from all places in Korea before leaving for Las Vegas. On Nov.25, starting at Nam Han River, they went up to Chung Pyung, and that day (Nov. 26), they went from Chung Pyung Dam up to the Peace Dam, which was established for the sake of protecting Korea from the flood attack by North Korean Im Nam Dam close to Geum Gang Mountain. At the Peace Dam, True Mother prayed and then True Father prayed for the perfection of God's fatherland.

Motive, process and results must be consistent in understanding and restoring the historical fact that Adam and Eve couldn't become True Parents. God's fatherland and motherland is that of Yong Myung Moon (Father's original name), the founder of the Unification Church, which realizes a delightful base of living with God by completing the ideal of family centering on one tradition and one blood lineage. This is the ultimate conclusion of today. (Father whistled.)"

      The nation and the (Korean) president (Lee Myung-bak) are the issues now. What I wish is that the president of this country, who can decide things, have the mindset to adapt himself to God's providence, but he doesn't have it. The issue is whether or not what they (he and his people) decide and want to do is still within the acceptable range. If they only want to do as they want, I must eternally cut off my relationship with them. If their <font face="Batang, serif"><span lang="zxx">??</span></font>(Jeong Seo / <font face="MS Mincho"><span lang="zxx">??</span></font>: love, emotion, feeling, sentiment) is more advanced than ours, we have to follow them, and if our <font face="Batang, serif"><span lang="zxx">??</span></font>is advanced, they must follow us. There aren't two ways but there is only one way.

      In Las Vegas, to have a network is the very foundation of exercising power. It is the last issue in this era of great change how to establish networks and educate them. A key to lead this city is education. The US is now standing at a crossroads, finding herself in diplomatic difficulties while being in a financial disaster. I, as a religious leader, am like an enemy to this city. I am a person that has been interested in this city and has studied it since I was a student. Also, after I came to the US, I have been preparing myself for the providence in this city. Do not say 'I will take responsibility for this city' but just follow me silently. This is a scary place and once you mistakenly say something, you will be caught and taken away.

      The providence centered on Las Vegas, the dungeon of hell. True Parents voluntarily took upon themselves strenuous spiritual conditions of indemnity, going without food and without sleep. Conditions were sometimes worse than for True Father than when he was at Danbury Federal Prison. Father many times had Hoon Dok Hae -- not on any schedule, 12 midnight or 2 am or anytime -- many times the Hoon Dok Hae lasted 12 hours.

    </p><p/><p>
      Father bought a building for the Peace Palace (later named International Peace Education Center). Also, centering on Rev. Jeong Soon Jo, Father will establish an Oriental medical school here. Father himself explored many dangerous places in the area. Likewise, God's side, starting from one point, will become bigger and bigger and Satan's side, though it seems so mighty, will perish. In the near future, people will know why True Parents, as a religious leader from the east, pioneered such a path in this sin city in the desert under the hot weather, and I strongly believe all humankind will follow Father's trace here. Until now many people came to this city and they all came here for their own pleasure. But nobody came here with a clear vision.

      (Katsumi: Father is right in a sense that 'Las' is the plural form of 'La,' which is 'the' in Spanish. But in the past Father has interpreted 'Las' as large.' I think this is one of the most important features in Father's linguistic life: he defines and creates the words according to given circumstances. I think this is related to Father's recent comments that 'substance / <span lang="zxx"><font face="Gulim, sans-serif">??</font></span>' comes before '<span lang="zxx"><font face="Gulim, sans-serif">??</font></span>/ words.')

      You are not Korean nor Japanese. Originally your lineage was the same, which came from Mongolia and that's why all of you have the Mongolian birthmark. All of these marks were gone when you were 7, 8 years old.

      The Mongolian birthmark is passed down by mothers. Whether a child is born with the Mongolian birthmark is determined based on its mother. 70 % of the world has this birthmark. If we could gather the ancestors connected there we could establish global kingship on that foundation.

<p>
      This is the report by Ms. McDevitt during Hoon Dok Hae on her trip to Dokdo Island with True Parents.
    </p><p/><p>
      "I shed tears when I saw the islands from above singing ___' Father had been saying that he would go to the islands, where even though it's Korean territory, one must prepare all kinds of documents to for receive visit permission. Shin Jun Nim, as the representative of True Children, accompanied True Parents.
    </p><p/><p>
      On 11.9 by the heavenly calendar, which is Dec. 3 on the solar calendar, we headed for the islands after Hoon Dok Hae, leaving the Cheon Jeong Gung at 7:20 a.m. I had a helicopter accident three years ago (with True Parents) and quite frankly, every time I ride on it, I am haunted by fear. However, since I was with True Parents and Shin Jun Nim who is the future owner, I accompanied them with faith. But until we landed on the island, I continued praying throughout the flight, calling in my prayer God, Heung Jin Nim, Dae Mo Nim, Hyo Jin Nim, Young Jin Nim, and all the good spirits.
    </p><p/><p>
      When I saw Dokdo, which consists of two islands called East Island and West Island, after the two-hour flight, I was deeply moved. They are also called the Father Island and the Mother Island. The weather was fine but it was very windy and so the helicopter had to try landing several times. Actually, we had heard that it happens often that helicopters can't land due to the wind, and I was so terrified, I was shouting in my mind, 'Father, we can't make it. Let's go back!'
    </p><p>
      There is a landing field on the top of the police building located on the West Island, and after we tried to land for about 10 minutes, we got a permission to use that spot and we could land there. Right after landing, many policemen ran up to the air station and took photos of True Parents. (Applause)
    </p><p>
      At the beginning I was surprised but then I was so happy to see them. Father was so happy and said, 'Police chief, come here.' They had been lonely in those small islands and saw such a beautiful helicopter, and so I guess they thought someone famous landed. They were so polite and respectful towards True Parents that I almost deluded myself thinking our members were welcoming True Parents.
    </p><p/><p/><p>
      Before leaving here, Father had told us to prepare food for people there and our bakery at the training center made 20 large pizza. (Shin Jun Nim just came in! He offered a bow to True Parents.) They also prepared chicken in a huge container and plenty of drinks and fruits. Later we heard one can't bring in any food at the islands, but we took them with us thinking that we can share them with our members at Ulleung Island. When I landed I talked to one police 'How cold you are here. Do you wear enough underwear? We have pizza, chicken, drinks and lots of fruits, but I heard it is prohibited to bring foods here. Can we leave them here?' Then he replied, 'Give them to us please. No problem.'
    </p><p/><p>
      So I reported that to True Parents, and our staff gave the food to the chief of the police. They were so happy and I am still curious how they enjoyed the foods. Father was happy and called all the policemen to take photos with him. I wanted to be with them but Father said 'Women, get out of here!' (Laughter) I went there terrified by the flight but I couldn't take a photo with True Parents. (Laughter) After taking photos, they, giving me their email addresses, asked me make sure to send them the photo.
    </p><p/><p>
      Shin Jun Nim was so happy shouting 'Dokdo, Dokdo!' He had talked with his teacher that he would go to the island with his grandfather, and actually, his teacher called one of the staff members and asked if he was really going to the island. We were in the strong wind on a small landing field at the top of the building. Father was worried about Shin Jun Nim who was running around and I held Father strongly with this slender body so that he wouldn't be blown away by the wind but it was so hard.
    </p><p/><p>
      Under such circumstances, I sang ___. When Father tells me to sing that song, I sing just imagining the island. But when I sang it there, I burst into tears thinking 'This is truly a historical island. How lonely you have been! True Father finally came to you who loves you so much.'
    </p><p/><p>
      Father wanted to walk around the lighthouse of the island, but the police chief said 'It is dangerous to walk there because of the wind.' So after we took photos and offered prayer, we took off there, and when we flew around the island before heading for Ulleung Island, I felt so grateful and honored.
    </p><p>
      At Ulleung Island, there is a church leader, Rev. Eun Hak Bek, who has been there for 10 years. There we enjoyed sashimi and vegetables from the island prepared by the local members. True Parents took photos with them, all of whom were shedding tears with joy, and later told the children there to 'study hard.' Then True Parents left by car to go around the island and offer Jeong Seong.
    </p><p/><p>
      This year, attending True Parents, I visited many places around Las Vegas such as Grand Canyon and Sedona, and I thought 'What a beautiful place this is!' But this time I found Ulleung Canyon at the island. Its beauty was so amazing. It has not been developed yet for tourism and so we couldn't closely go there.
    </p><p/><p>
      I felt Father was planning many things in his mind, and it was a great opportunity for me to think again about Father's course. I visited Dok Do and Ulleung Do this time representing all of you. Thank you."

      On Satan's side, even if they are good, they can't go beyond the national level. That is the limitation of the Satanic world. Satan can't go beyond the national level. It can't have the concept 'for the sake of the world.' Even they say such a thing, they can't go beyond their national interests.
    </p><p/><p>
      For example, the Soviet Union nowadays, which advocates 'Alliance of the communist countries in the world,' can't go beyond its national level. You should know this clearly. Satan can't have a concept 'for the sake of the world,' though they say it, which is a lie."

      I have to teach you the things that you will come to know. This involves tens of thousands of questions. Yet, nobody has been able to answer a single one. There are now more than 2,700 volumes of my sermons. You and your descendants of the 3rd, 4th, and 7th generations will not be able to study them. This is not a laughing matter.

      Look at it. I have entrusted all of this to Mother. Before, I had checked to see whether it was prepared. How many times have you read this book? The content of today's instructions are in this book. This book is my "second self." This time I have revised the introduction. The era before the coming of heaven have both passed in Europe. What is the difference between these two eras? Isn't it in the title? What does it say? What is the title? If you look at this, the title, what does it say? What is the title? All of Rev. Moon's secrets are in this. Everything can be explained with this title. I have proclaimed the word, the Word by God's Substantial Self.

      Do we say "vertical and horizontal" or "horizontal and vertical"? What comes first? When we say mind and body, what comes first? The vertical element does. The body is horizontal. Who determined this? It wasn't me. When it comes to the God of Night and the God of Day, the ancestors who can be the origin of history and the basis that can be the origin of the family of humanity are vertical and horizontal. When we talk about history, what world do we say we live in? Buddhism speaks of deliverance, doesn't it? You cannot say, "I don't need the vertical or the horizontal aspects of life." If you didn't know that vertical and horizontal aspects exist, could you achieve deliverance without God? It would remain a dream even after a million years. It is all a big lie. How can what is horizontal lead to deliverance from worldly ties without the vertical elements? When you level the ground for a house, you follow the standard of the perpendicular. You center on the vertical standard; that is your focus....

      Originally, perfected human beings are a valuable existence which can dominate the angelic world and the whole cosmos. But due to the fall, they fell down by several ranks, and so they must go up to their original state. In that course, they can't make it at once: they should go up step by step through the course of restoration starting from the individual level to the familial, tribal, racial, national, and the worldwide levels.
    </p><p/><p>
      In order to go up to a higher level, an indemnity condition must be paid. It can't be achieved within a couple of days: a certain time period based on the principle number is necessary such as 7 years, 40 years, 70 years or even several centuries. So some spirits, who had helped earthly people, go back to the spirit world on the way without being able to continue to a higher level.
    </p><p/><p>
      For example, if a spirit self named Paul helped person A but this person couldn't pay indemnity conditions and make a foundation within a requested period and died, Paul chooses person B and wants to resurrect through that person, in order for him to go up to a higher level. So Paul who resurrects through person B is the same spirit self that could have resurrected through person A. There must be a certain period without fail and the periods are always principle numbers, and if the person B can't make it, Paul chooses person C for resurrection. Under such circumstances, <b>person A, B or C could say 'I am Paul,' and people, by seeing such external phenomena without knowing the whole picture, come to believe the doctrine of reincarnation</b>.

      "What is the ultimate purpose of God's providence? People think the purpose of religion is to sacrifice and be beneficial for the society. So do the religious people. But when we think of it centering on God, to give good influences to the society is secondary, and the primary purpose is to establish True Parents on earth. If not for True Parents, nothing can be further achieved. To indemnify the birth from evil parents and win victory totally depends on establishing good parents. This is a crucial issue that can be solved only by God."

      I am a person who pioneers to establish schools, and actually made junior high and high schools, and universities. However, you are still on the level of a junior high or high school student (spiritually). If you can't fill the gap, my all efforts will come to naught.

      True Father visited Osan School on HC 6. 15 (Aug. 2, 2012). That day, True Father suddenly decided to visit the school and moved to Seoul. He seemed to miss his school years.
    </p><p/><p>
      Osan school was found by True Father's great grandfather Yoon Kook Moon and Teacher Sung Hoon Lee in Jeong Ju, North Korea. It was reopened in Busan after the Korean war and re-established in November 26, 1955 in Bo Kwang Dong, Yong San Ku, Seoul.
    </p><p/><p>
      True Father was admitted to Osan School in 1934, at the age of 15 to learn modern science. He had received patriotic education based on Christianity at this school until he was transferred to Jeong Joo school one year later.
    </p><p>
      True Father visited the school at around 5 pm and there was a scorching heat on that day. True Father listened to the testimony by Chang Yeol Lee, his cousin on mother's side and is an Ex-president of Il Seong construction company. True Father recalled his past while listening to the testimony and spoke for 3 hours and returned to Chung Pyung.
    </p><p/><p>
      While speaking that day, he coughed quite often but it didn't seem to bother him. He kept on speaking to the people who were attending him and they all felt sorry for his condition.

      Once I start praying, I usually go for 12 hours and sometimes even for 17 hours. (Through my prayer) I realized the path of the Divine Principle, who God is, what the relationship between God and myself is, and so on. It was not that I looked after God but that God came to, embraced and raised me since He needed me. I do not like being the founder of the Unification church. I do not like being the Messiah or the Second Coming or the king of kings.

      The seven great religions need to serve the True Parents of Heaven, Earth and Humankind. If our original ancestors had not eaten the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden, they would not have died. Once you eat that fruit, that world will be wiped away by your action. Therefore, textbooks and teaching materials need to be made so that people can learn to remain the chosen ones who will not eat that fruit. That is my ideology, and the crux of my life, which has gone in one direction. You should not forget that..

      When Rev. Moon went to the mountains in the past, I could not stand it if I did not go to the other side of the mountain and enjoy the scenery there, because I have so much curiosity. No matter how hard it is to climb up the mountain, unless I go to the other side and look at the scenery, I would feel terrible.  With this strong inquisitiveness, I discovered the world of the Principle. I have to make inquiries when I start looking into anything. If I could not see and investigate even one angle, I would feel I was cheated out of the truth.

      The principle is more precious than anything else. Have you ever thought of the principle being more precious than eating your meals, wearing your clothes, or sleeping?

      What recently impressed me (from listening to his own speech) is it is only Yong Myung Moon (Father's original name) that found and clarified that the principle of Cain and Abel is the fundamental principle of the cosmos and so it is my patent. If one understands this principle, that means they understand 70% of the secret of the cosmos. All the relationships in the cosmos are based on the principle of Cain and Abel. Then where should be the center of it? It is exactly in the middle.

      But you must know Abel can exist only with the presence of Cain. Abel is necessary in order to restore parents. Abel is necessary in order to restore fallen Adam and Eve to the original status. Abel came to exist to restore the parents. If not for the fall, neither Abel nor Cain would have been necessary. Due to the fall, through the person called Abel, the parents must be restored.

      In order to restore relationship with true parents, Abel and Cain must be united and stand in such a position

      (Katsumi: By 'resurrection' in the speech, Father meant what the Chinese characters of the term indicates, which is 'to live again.' Father's explanation following that definition (in which he said 'tradition, blood lineage and resemblance') leads us to understanding <b>'resurrection' as 'to live again or to live a new life in resembling True Parents after rebirth</b>.' This is not contradictory to the teaching of the Divine Principle, but rather, it gives us a more dynamic understanding of 'resurrection.)

      (From Tom Cutts) True Father said the greatest gift he could give us is the gift of understanding indemnity.

      This is very important. The purpose of indemnity is restoration. Restoration of what? <b>Restoration of your relationship with God</b> is what. Therefore, if true indemnity has been paid, the net result will be that you feel closer to God. If you feel farther away from God's love, then indemnity has not been paid. In fact, Satan has gotten the victory. It is Satan's will to separate you more from God. If you feel closer to God, indemnity has been paid. If you feel farther away from God, indemnity has not been paid.

      Many times a person will get some physical injury and others will say, "You're paying indemnity." Please don't think that physical suffering is indemnity. It might be, but then again it might not be. Indemnity is spiritual only. Unless there is some spiritual benefit as a result of the physical suffering, no indemnity has been "paid." Heartistic indemnity is spiritual (mN: I think such as sacrifice to help to sacrifice your pride). Therefore a small amount of heartistic indemnity can be far, far superior to a great amount of physical suffering. It is all decided by how much you become closer to God as a result.
    </p><p/><p>
      Examples
    </p><p/><p>
      Let me also clear up some of the confusion about "lesser than, equal to, and greater indemnity." Lesser indemnity is always the case in the Unification Church. You never have to pay the full amount. Because of the True Parents it's always a lesser amount. You never even have to pay equal indemnity. That is an Old Testament concept back before Jesus came and back before anyone knew anything about the Parental Heart of God.
    </p><p/><p>
      Greater indemnity will never have to be paid as long as you maintain a sincere heart. Abraham, when he had to sacrifice his son Isaac, was not paying "greater indemnity." Sure it was greater than the sacrifice of the animals, but it was not greater than all the sins of himself and the human ancestors. Abraham through it all was sincere to do God's will, so he was actually paying "lesser indemnity." He did not, in the end, have to kill his son, he only had to offer him, which was tremendous heartistic indemnity.
    </p><p/><p>
      "Greater indemnity" only applies if a person remains insincere and unrepentant. Greater indemnity should be thought of like this. If someone hurts you or wrongs you, then you cannot feel love for them. As long as they remain insincere or unrepentant you cannot love them. You could have a condition to love them only if you saw them suffering. If you see they are suffering more than they have made you suffer, then you have the condition to forgive them and begin loving them. This is an example where the person has paid "greater indemnity." Your heart wants to love them now because of their suffering. You are just waiting for them to turn to you to seek a relationship again.
    </p><p/><p>
      If a person has hurt you, your heart will become closed. But as soon as a person becomes sincere and repentant, your heart automatically wants to open up to them. It could be a long time before you see a person's sincerity, but when you finally see it, your heart begins to open. Always at that point "lesser indemnity" is operating. The relationship is in the process of being restored and neither party wants to needlessly delay the reunion.

<p>
      God's grace comes to you only after indemnity conditions have been paid. If one pays indemnity conditions before the time has come, even a materialistic condition (of lesser indemnity) can work in order to recover human affairs. Therefore, people always need to pursue good. This means they can walk the path of making indemnity conditions in advance. When one in the individual period pays indemnity conditions for their familial level, they can easily go the path when they are actually in the familial period.

      Father said in his speech that the term "Blessing marriage" is not the invention of the Unification church but is God's ideal which God wanted to realize through creation. He also said the Blessing in the course of restoration is not for the sake of an individual but for establishing a new tribe, nation and the world. He said the <b>purpose of history is to find Adam and then he needs to recreate Eve</b>, and therefore Jesus must have established his own family before establishing new tribe, new nation and the new world.

<p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
      The Blessing you receive takes place at the completion level of the growth stage where Adam and Eve fell, and from that point you must go up. But this task can't be done alone. Since Adam and Eve fell together, husband and wife must go up together in this course of restoration. Restoring the conjugal relationship that fell centering on Satan, they must go up that period centering on God.
    </p><p style="margin-left: 0.79in"/><p style="margin-left: 0.79in">
      That's why it is not that everything has been done when you receive the Blessing. <b>The Blessing means that<font size="4"> God and human beings</font> as the people of the heavenly nation can have a horizontal relationship for the first time in which <font size="4">they can cooperate</font> with each other</b>.

      Even if you have learned the Principle and received the blessing, the blessing you have received is not the actual blessing but only the condition you see to escape from the snares of the satanic world. After receiving the blessing, you need to be turned completely around the right way, so that you are right side up.
    </p><p/><p>
      Think about it based on the Principle. Did sons and daughters exist before True Parents? No. 1 Whose sons and daughters are you? Are you True Parents' sons and daughters? Are you the sons and daughters of God, of the God of Night and the God of Day? Well? Which is it? Where do you fit in? You are the archangel's sons and daughters. Once you have that answer, the Principle makes clear sense. Asking or answering any more questions is unnecessary. You have to pay indemnity. If you don't know how to indemnify this, you cannot enter the kingdom of heaven. You need to clearly understand. You need to cross thirteen (mN:13) stages. You need to cross them with complete faith in me. It is all about absolute faith, absolute love and absolute obedience....

<p>
      If you view the flow of history through eyes that focus on God's providence, you can see that the<b> changes of the times can be broadly classified into three stages</b>. First was the <b>nature-centered era</b>, a time when instinctual feelings, materialism and a closeness to animals and the things of creation were prevalent. Next came a <b>human-centered era</b>. when people's knowledge, feelings and emotions took precedence and dominated the world.
    </p><p/><p>
      However, these eras were transitional. They were courses of preparation necessary in order to enter the era in which people could rid themselves of their fallen nature, return to their original selves and live as one united family where they attend to God as their father. When that happens we will enter a <b>God-centered era</b>, the final stage in which human beings who know and feel God's Heart and Will follow the path of living for the sake of others. They will do this through establishing an absolute standard on the foundation of purifying themselves, both inside and out, through the holy Blessing Ceremony. This is the time of opening up the era of God's kingdom, Cheon Il Guk, a time in which we can return to the heart of the one true God. Please engrave this point on your hearts.

      The three archangels were Lucifer, Gabriel and Michael. Lucifer was the central archangel. He created the devil's tradition and planted the devil's seeds. Those seeds didn't die. They occupied the world and all of heaven and earth, and the God of Night and the God of Day, the Creator, was lost. How can we reveal the terrible original basis of the Fall? It is not in the Principle of Creation. What caused this? What is the Fall?...

      God follows and protects me.

That time is coming. Where will you go? Well, the answer is in the words of this speech.

      Like all human beings, Father has the spirit self and the physical self, both of which consist of 'mind' and 'body' respectively: The spirit self has a spirit mind and spirit body, and the physical self has a physical mind and physical body. When we see people on earth, we only see their physical self, not their spirit self. By the same token, <b>when we see people in the spirit world where we exist as a spirit self, we only see their spirit body, not their spirit mind</b>.

      What's the difference between the soul and the spirit self? The soul refers only to the shell, whereas the spirit self refers to the inner and the outer aspects of a person. Therefore, the soul can be deceived and used by evil spirits. People who have lived in evil can just take this empty shell and fool others into believing that it is the real thing. In short, they are imposters.

      Jesus said to Satan, "It is written: 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"(Matthew 4:4) This is very real. Have I lived until now because I labored? Or have I lived because of money? It is neither. I have lived by holding on to God's word. As you see, I did not perish.

      Father said one must find the best time for prayer and pray at that time because the time zone for the prayer is different from each other. Father also said one must pray with absolute faith, and prayer is like a root which must be planted deeply and doesn't appear in public. Father said if one leads a life of faith such way, they will have premonitions of what will happen that day.

      When you wake up for morning prayer and sit up straight, if there is a table three meters in front of you, there should be a point a meter and forty centimeters from the table. You must offer the same full bow there. People in the spirit world are united, because they all keep this practice. If you keep doing it at least for three months, your mind will take its proper position.

      I made royal seals for the Father and the Mother. In your families, you should attend photos [of True Parents] that have those seals on them. I Always pray before breakfast and lunch and offer your sincere devotion. If you hang up a photograph with those seals on it, lay a copy of my speech in front of it, and offer a prayer that brings unity, Satan will leave the earth.

Up to MA, he could do whatever lie liked -- killing someone or letting him live -- but now things are turning around. We have to restore all that Satan was trying to destroy in history. Only then will we move into a future when we thrive and prosper. If you don't keep pace, you will be taken away. Your ancestors may simply decide. We had better quickly remove this family from this earthly world. You must know that such a fearsome time is coming. Please offer your sincere devotion.

      1. According to Father, "the prayer of the Messiah of the Second Advent" or "the prayer of True Parents" consists of two parts. The former is from "Moderation (<font face="Gulim, sans-serif">??</font>/<font face="MS Gothic">??</font>), written by Confucius' grandson <font face="Gulim, sans-serif">??</font>(<font face="MS Gothic">??</font>/ Jasa), one of the Seven Chinese Classics (the Four Books and the Three Classics). Which says: <font face="MS Gothic">????????</font>(<font face="Gulim, sans-serif">????????</font>) <font face="MS Gothic">????????</font>(<font face="Gulim, sans-serif">????????</font>). This basically means that spring, summer, autumn and winter, which respectively represents foundation, growth, harvest and conclusion of life, are unchanging heavenly law, and that is also the way that humans are, who pursue love, righteousness, courtesy and knowledge in order to go along with such a Heaven. The latter part is Father's providential viewpoint of realizing the ideal word, and I don't know the exact words of Father in his prayer. Basically he explains by uniting England, the US, France, Japan, Germany and Italy centering on True Parents' family, the world of peace will be established.

      "Without achieving harmony, unification cannot take place. Unless your five senses function harmoniously, unification of your mind and body will never happen. Why do your mind and body fight against each other? Why? You do not know the answer. This is the fundamental problem. Why do they fight? Yours too, right? ('Yes') Then why? This is life-and-death issue. So far, there was no philosophical answer to this question and therefore, (humankind) has been in confusion."

      Ask your mind. Ask your mind about everything. The mind is more central than God. You need to hear the voice of your mind. If you feel something fearful, you should not be involved. You should not do that. You can know it without fail. For example, before you visit your friend's house, you must be able to know if doing so is beneficial to you or not?

      Of course sometimes you get tired and weak, and want to give up. But at those times you must think, "God, You have suffered more than I have. True Parents, you have suffered more than I have. Heavenly Father, I am so grateful that I can do this, or just still breathing now. And as long as my life remains -- until I shed my last drop of blood -- I will live for You." When you think this way and express your gratitude to God, Satan has no way to hook you. Then you are totally free to go beyond the satanic realm and to be like Jesus, completely one with God.

      Father advised that one should practice their lectures chapter by chapter rather than trying to cover from the beginning the whole contents of the Divine Principle. For example, if one practices their lectures only on the Principle of Creation for one month, they can have a clear understanding of it. He also emphasized that every each person can give lectures without exception.

      Father said that by evaluating our audience by checking their responses, we need to rank them intro three categories. The most difficult types are put into the first rank, and the lecturer needs to fight against them. Father said we need to check their faces after 10 minutes to see if they become more stern or become relaxed, without being noticed by them that we are checking it. Also lecturers need to make the audience to be relaxed with laughter: once they laugh, they come to listen to the lecture.

      'Resurrection' argued in the Divine Principle exactly fits the reality in the spirit world and it teaches you the formal course in the spirit world. Throughout history, many religious people experienced the spirit world without comprehending how the spirit world works. When you study the principle, don't learn it just thinking of the logic. You must understand and practice the principle, and make a victorious foundation. For example, after having understood the fact about Noah's family, Abraham's family, Moses' course, and the history of Jesus and the John the Baptist, you need to make indemnity conditions for all of them and restore victorious foundations.

      When did the four rules of arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) start to be used? Was it before or after the human fall? Nobody has thought of it. Addition and multiplication are like friends with each other, and they cannot be separated. Subtraction and division seem similar but they dislike each other. 1 + 1 = 2 but 1 - 1 = 0 and so nothing remains. 1 + 3 = 4 but if 3 is divided by 4, (the number 3) is gone. How come such mathematics was created? There are single numbers, and then comes the number 10. From there it must go to 11 but how can it do so? Everything has its reciprocal partner, and the physics and geometry which do not have such a concept have been fundamentally mistaken.

      When a baby cries saying 'Omma' one can know if they makes their families and tribes prosperous or not by seeing if they do so while putting their face up or down
    </p><p/><p>
      Men and women are different regarding this. When a baby girl cries, they put their faces down saying 'Appa' or 'Omma.' But a baby boy is different. They put their faces up when crying and calling 'Appa' but they put their faces down calling 'Omma.' It is scary that the baby boys know that when mothers become old, they must follow their sons, and they could not be good mothers otherwise. Those women here who snap at and kick their sons are all thieves. Their sons will think, 'My mother must be removed since she became an obstacle in my family and tribe.' They know this kind of thing when they become 7 years old. You do not know even this kind of thing and so you women here are all false."

When a man and woman are not husband and wife and a baby in the womb is aborted, the baby goes to the spirit world and tries to pull them over into the fog.

      I have a particular characteristic: if I go into a situation that isn't right, my mouth becomes dry. When I try to speak, my tongue gets stuck and does not move. What do I do then? What should I do? That is why I am hesitant about confronting difficult problems, lest I do harm to the nation's people. I don't know whether I am standing in such a position or not, but when I say in my mind that someone is bad, they will become bad. Supposing I were to say, "He won't do well." Had I not said that, I could have at least harbored hope for him in heart, but having said it, what could I do if indeed that reality came about? You don't know how much responsibility I have.

      Since I was one and half year old, I heard absolute sounds. After I became 12 months old, I came to see all kinds of spiritual things such as satanic spirits fighting against each other in the air. I said to myself, 'What is that?' Whenever I was fed on my mom's breast, a spiritual thing like a scarecrow and an animal appeared without fail which I could see only lower parts of the body. Then when I was one and half year old, I came to know absolute sounds."

      Women are not there to help or to be protected by men; rather, they are independent individuals who, as representatives of the feminine aspect of God's nature, are meant to make men more complete and manly. Centering on True Love, women are the precious partners of love to men. In terms of value, men and women are absolutely equal beings. Men and women who unite through the True Love of original ideal share the same position. Also, they attain the right to be with each other wherever they may be. Furthermore, they attain the ideal right of inheritance, where each other's properties will belong to each other equally. Thus, men and women, who are brought into oneness through original love under God's ideal of true love, have been created to become completely equal beings, centered on true love, by sharing not only the same rank and the right of participation but also their possessions with one another.

       "What is the difference between a father and a mother? Are they the same? Since God needs to give from upper position, man is bigger than woman. That's why women, who cannot take the lead, must follow man. When we see the way man and woman are dressed, we can conclude that man needs to keep their body cool and woman needs to keep their body warm. Since this is true, your mind does not feel strange when you listen to that. This appears as a principle and is right at any time such as daytime, night-time, when you were a child, or in the spirit world, and so you must follow and live in time with it."

If convex and concave are on the same line, why do they need each other? Parents and children are different. Summer and fall are different. That is the way the cosmos is."

Anyone who has enjoyed free sex will have no means of hiding that fact from anyone.

      Why do we say left and right instead of right and left? Did you know that is correct? Parent and child relationship is correct. "Top and bottom" is correct. Before the fall nobody used the term "left and right." It came about after the fall. Before the fall you said it in the order of "top, bottom, right and left." It was "top, bottom, right, left, front and back."

      Once I was listening to my speech with my eyes closed and thought 5 minutes had passed. But (I realized) it was actually 5 hours. That's why (when people are intoxicated with my speech) they behave like crazy people. I am moved when I listen to my recorded speech while thinking who is speaking such words through me. In prayer one must be able to be united with such heavenly words and experience loud weeping. Such atmosphere is not something you make but Heaven does, and when you really miss such moment, Heaven would give you great joy even if you are in the prison. These (speeches) are not mine but Heaven's. That's why these can be the textbooks in the spirit world. <b>You can see the whole cosmos moves in time with these words</b>.

      The seven great religions need to serve the True Parents of Heaven, Earth and Humankind. If our original ancestors had not eaten the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden, they would not have died. Once you eat that fruit, that world will be wiped away by your action. Therefore, textbooks and teaching materials need to be made so that people can learn to remain the chosen ones who will not eat that fruit. That is my ideology, and the crux of my life, which has gone in one direction. You should not forget that....

      I was told that the tsunami that followed the earthquake came right up to the front of our church and then took a ninety-degree turn and receded.... One car was lifted up by the tsunami, toward a hillock. There was a cleft in the hill. The vehicle was caught in the cleft, and the driver survived. There were many people who survived in circumstances no human being could live through. You should hear those reports. When I heard them, I thought they were all concocted by our church members; they seemed like tall tales. After sending Hyung-jin there I found out they were true....

      Although human beings are not aware of it, there must exist a standard for that center that can fill up any vacuum and create equilibrium in any part of the world centering on God. Otherwise, the universe would be destroyed. Under these circumstances, the great universe would crash, break up and disappear. Yet because of this harmony, it does not.
    </p><p/><p>
      The great universe itself is unaware that it revolves. It maintains equilibrium by allowing the high ground to become low and the low ground to be raised. That is why these days they are saying that the snakes and ants are all fleeing Mt. Baekdu in fear that it will erupt. Human beings may not be aware of it, but the animals in nature are. God does not wipe out species.

      Ears, eyes, mouth and nose, what comes first? ('Ears.') Why? When you trim the four corners of the Chinese character of ears (which is ?), it becomes the Chinese character of eyes (which is ?). The ears are connected to the eyes. These are on the same line. You should know that the order of these words ????(????: ears, eyes, mouth and nose) had existed before the fall. The fact that our ancestors knew this order means that they knew there are east, west, north and south." (mN: should be east, west, south, north ?)
    </p><p/><p>
      Ears, eyes, mouth and then nose. This is the right order. It is eyes that understand quickly what you hear. (For example) When you hear something, your eyes try to see it. Then with your ?(mouth), you will say, 'Who are you?' Then you try to smell them. That is the way it is."

      I used for myself the electric healing device that I invented (which is Happy Health Machine) everyday for the past months and saw the outcome by myself. Everybody need to use this too, like (True) Mother, and those who believe the power of this and grace of Heaven, can let all diseases go from their family.

      If you pray when you are sick, I will teach you immediately regarding which direction you should take. When you pray, you know it right away. True Parents are the persons who can put the cause of the disease under control and so they can fully clean up the environment. So when you stand on a unified common base of the nation and the world with True Parents, and pray knowing you can be the motive and the results which will influence others as well, there is nothing you cannot do. Patients will be sick again within without fail since Satan, which was with that body, will come back. But if you have somebody who has the same faith and is in the same blood through the Blessing along with you, Satan cannot work on you or you can naturally find how to heal yourself.
    </p><p/><p>
      "There is a formula and if you know it you do not have to worry: Satan will escape from you. I said (Katsumi: it is in North Korean dialect, which means something which does not exist but seems to exist. But it seems Father uses the term indicating something that exists spiritually). When you pass a crossroad which is connected to east, west, north and south, it will ask you without fail from where you come from, north, south, east or west. If you do not answer, it will immediately give you pain by kicking you. It thinks 'Why didn't you answer, even when you know the answer!' When it helps you heal but you do not follow, it will not help you again. When you become sick, you cannot heal yourself alone. You need to find a motive with which you can be united with heaven and earth, and have to know where you reside for the harvest."
    </p><p/><p>
      "Those who pray a lot say 'vertical and horizontal' not 'horizontal and vertical.' 'Vertical' comes first."

      The way to heal any kind of disease is to touch all parts of your body and find if there is any painful part. Some will find three pain points even with one finger. Your mind knows where they are when you push your body with your fingers. Then release that pain (by massaging), and you will be cured. That is the unification through harmony in your body.

      "Did the Persian dynasty start before Jesus' time or after that? (Nobody answered) It was about 700 years before Jesus.
    </p><p>
      (Using his hands to explain) At number 7, partners can meet each other and therefore the dynasty started more than 700 years ago before Jesus time. That was the absolute dynasty (which should have been realized on God's side) before the human fall.
    </p><p>
      (Father seemed concerned about the camera shooting for a second.)
    </p><p>
      The Persian dynasty was the absolute dynasty. The constitutional monarchy has a reversed form and therefore it is centered on woman (for example, Queen Elizabeth II of England), but the blood lineage isn't consistent. Consequently they don't resemble the previous generation. The seeds are different and so they don't resemble their previous generation.
    </p><p>
      (Katsumi: I think Father talks here the importance of the unbroken blood lineage of Kings which can be inherited through sons.)

      The constitutional monarchy has a reversed form and therefore it is centered on woman (for example, Queen Elizabeth II of England), but the blood lineage isn't consistent. Consequently they don't resemble the previous generation. The seeds are different and so they don't resemble their previous generation.

      I have been investing in the ocean industry and developing marine-related technology for more than 50 years. My purpose has been to liberate humankind from suffering and death due to hunger. In the 1980s I built the Good-Go ships and laid a foundation for the ocean industry in more than thirty locations throughout the United States, including Kodiak, Alaska, and the Gulf of Mexico. In the 1990s, I invested in the ocean industry in South America, particularly in Brazil and Uruguay, thus creating a global marine network connecting 52 nations. On this foundation, in the new millennium I have been developing Yeosu, situated on the southern coast of Korea, and Hawaii, situated at the center of the Pacific Ocean, to become hubs of the ocean industry in the Pacific Rim Era

      Today you will be introduced to the Gypsum Plaster Mold method, which I devised, and participate in the launching of the Won Mo Boat, which was built using this and other new technologies. Beginning with the Cheon Jeong Boat, launched in Yeosu six months ago, Master Marine is opening a new global horizon in the shipbuilding industry and is contributing greatly to innovation in marine transportation in Korea and all of Asia, improving the quality of life for all
    </p><p/><p>
      What is the Resin Plaster Mold Manufacturing Method?
    </p><p/><p>
      In boat construction, wooden or FRP molds were utilized for building a boat hull and deck. This not only made the building process complicated but it also made the surface of the mold rough, compromising the quality of the outside planking and creating other problems. Resin Plaster Mold Manufacturing Method,invented by the Rev. Dr. Sun Myung Moon and perfected by Master Marine, Inc., solves this problem. This technology simplifies the process of boat building, reducing manufacturing cost and time in an innovative way.

      The boat twice the intensity, half the weight, and its boat building period will be reduced by 30%. They said it is Rev. Moon, who has been dedicating himself for developing shipbuilding technology from 1960's, that invented the resin molding for building the boat.

      The boat that we are making now is very different from all other ones. After Father came back from Europe, he said at Hoon Dok Hae at Yeosu all creatures that depend on air can have and transfer all energies, and then suddenly told us to make a boat utilizing air. Father had talked about that idea before, but we have never been able to proceed with it in reality. The lightest material is hydrogen (H), but it combusts too easily, and so we came to conclusion that we cannot use it as material to run a boat on. Then we examined helium (He), and found out it worked. We already applied for a patent for this new technology.

      (Father heard the report that they were preparing a 3D video clip to show on the Foundation Day. Putting 3D glasses, he said) "Video viewers couldn't be as excited as the video shooters because they couldn't see things in three dimensions. They would be able to feel reality when they see the 3D video clip. I gave the direction to <b>Kajikuri (Rev. Kajikuri, the president of the Unification Church in Japan) to develop a camera which can take pictures of the spirit world</b>. In the future, we will watch reality in the spirit world through pictures rather than watching 3D movies. <b>Jesus comes to me to greet me, and when you see such a reality, you will stop daydreaming.</b> Then we won't need any lecturers to educate.

      "The most important thing (in singing) is to correct wrong pronunciations (of the lyrics) and ill-fitted feelings to the songs you like to sing.

      I am grateful to God for becoming a major controversial figure in the religious world. This is a hard path. We are not fighting against a visible enemy. I must win the invisible battle. It is very difficult. Do you agree with me? Have we ever protested against all the accusations that the media uses to attack the Unification church in Japan? I never allowed our church in Korea to offer apology or explanation to the media even though the Korean media has persecuted us for over a decade. Why? God has never apologized for the history of restoration. Has the Bible given excuses for history? Truth is eternal, and God is eternal. Whoever denies God is truly a miserable being. Therefore, to give such a miserable being your apology or explanation is not logical. If you are true, you don't need to explain or apologize what you do. You will expand and progress despite being persecuted.

      If I was hit by the enemy more than was justified by the Principle, all the blessings will be shifted to God's side and Abel's side without question

This proclamation signified that Father connected all the fruits of his work in the US (where the Heavenly fortune had arrived after circulating on the globe starting from the Middle East via Europe), to Korea, God's homeland, by centering on Hawaii in place of the Eve Nation that could not accomplish her responsibility then.

      "Abel Women UN. We haven't had 'mother.' People have said 'Heavenly Father,' but who can fix the problems among religions and restore the authority of the country? We don't have a woman yet who can represent the Abel Women UN. Since Adam couldn't fulfill his responsibility, he lost Eve. Eve kicked out Father, heaven and earth, and I have found and educated Mother preparing her to attend. With the strong determination that I will put Mother in the position of the wife of Adam who represents the Creator, I have been recreating Mother throughout my life so that I can present her in front of the whole world with such a status, even if they strongly oppose it."
    </p><p/><p>
      I would like to emphasize once again that the <b>priority of 'Abel Women UN' should be the true family movement of living for the sake of others, based on true love</b>, carried out in conjunction with proper values education. War and conflict arises from selfish motives of desiring to take others' land, possessions or the like by force. On the other hand, peace arises from investing oneself for the sake of others, that is, giving based on true love.

Here (in Las Vegas and the USA) will be<b> the origin from which we can remove the world of ice at the North and South poles</b>. Who will open up those areas and be responsible for the natural resources, including all kinds of fish? I can feel there are lots of fish here and that is our hope.

(Yes) There are not only fish, but also huge quantities of natural resources to develop in this backward region, which is bigger than Asia in scale, and when we really develop those we can conclude our activities and become the ancestors of the region.

That's why Father announced at Kona that he must conclude the restoration of human beings by giving the Original Divine Principle Lecture (Education on the Origin of the Principle) (mN: Original means the time before the fall. Principle before the fall) after the era when we gave the Divine Principle lecture to lead fallen humankind.

      There is Bek Rok Dam (a pond on the top of Hal la mountain in Jejudo).

      I can take care of the Bering Strait tunnel and Japan tunnel -- myself -- If I ask you to raise the money, we could make it -- I could make it through Korea and Japan alone. Through the tunnels we can promote the exchange marriage program between Russia and America. We should promote this.

      More Father visited St. Peter's and more he felt a spiritual heaviness.  The mission of our Father is giving the Blessing, tomorrow, to 10 million people... It is Father's desire and God's.

      He also said he was surprised to see such a building like St. Peter's cathedral dedicated to Peter, when the Apostle Peter actually denied Jesus 3 times. At that moment I felt the immense sorrow of God, the pain of Jesus over the rejection by the religious authorities of the time, the failure of John the Baptist, of his own family and his followers who could not unite with him and could not follow him in his mission.

      Leading the display was Dr. Dow-soon Im, who discovered a simple demonstration of the way in which a person's spiritual energy -- ki -- can be increased or radically diminished by the objects in his or her immediate surroundings. The volunteers gripped thumb and index finger together, and then Im or another volunteer would try to break the grip. Logically, it seems that strong men would have always more powerful grips than small women -- but it doesn't seem to work out that way. It all seems to depend on what the person making the "grip" holds in their other hand, and the energy associated with that object.   Volunteers who held onto objects with positive spiritual energy, such as a picture of Jesus, Father's recently-published autobiography, or even the program of the event, found that their grip was immensely strengthened and could scarcely be broken. But when they held an object with negative energy the situation was reversed!

      Therefore, (in writing in Chinese character Jinhwa??  (evolution), it shouldn't be ??  which implies 'to evolve and change'). The world of creation is that of harmony and so it should be ??

      It is not about the first heaven or the second heaven. The Apostle Paul went across the mountains and the seas and offered devotions for fourteen years. Why did he do that? He spoke of the third heaven, which is the place of the perfection and completion of liberation, but he himself could not go to that place. Even now, he cannot go there because he is tied to the history of restoration through indemnity on earth. Together with True Parents, the God of Night and the God of Day, our Creator, was lost.

      So when you read the Bible, you should read it soulfully. You might think it would be better to read it quickly but you should be moved by even reading it slowly. Then you would realize like 'I haven't been able to do such thing. This figure has a better mindset than that of our pastor and elders of the church. When I pray to God, I feel what this person did was not wrong.' If you deal the issue such way, a better way will be widely open."

      The Bible speaks of this world -- this is what is amazing in the Bible. "And there was evening, and there was morning -- the first day." This is important. What is missing here is that there was evening, and then passing through the night, and then the next morning came Thus, after the evening passed and the morning came, which was the first day. This signifies that there is a God of Day and a God of Night. God could not welcome that first day on which He could say; "...there was morning -- the first day." You need to be aware of this.  I will say something about the Book of Genesis. You cannot find what's in the Book of Genesis in any other holy scripture in the world. People don't know about Genesis. There is a God of Night and a God of Day; and He is divided. The beginning point at which night and day could be unified, and nighttime adjusted so that it could be one with day, has not been seen in the course of history.

      The Bible says 'And there was evening, and there was morning--the first day.' Its meaning seems so vague, but nobody knows it implies the three stages of life in creation."

      The Bible says  'And there was evening and there was morning, one day.' There was evening and then morning came and therefore one might think that it should be the second day. Where did the night go? This statement is centering on the number 3. I am the person who pondered why it is the first day."

One could say 'Ham did a good thing and what's wrong with it?' His child must have greeted Noah, even taken off his clothes too.

      "The reason why the Bible is amazing among numerous religious teachings is because
    </p><p/><p><b>Firstly</b> it says God is Father of all humankind, which is the fountain of Christian thought.
    </p><p/><p><b>Secondly</b>, in the New Testament, it says <b>Jesus is the only-begotten Sun </b>of God. What the only-begotten Sun means the son who can receive Heavenly Father's love for the first time in history.
    </p><p/><p>
      Then <b>thirdly</b> Christianity has the idea of<b> bride and groom</b>. Jesus is the only-begotten Son but<b> he came as a groom and so he needs a bride</b>. As the only-begotten Son, he needs the only-begotten Daughter. The day of the feast for the bride and the groom means the day God's love appears. But this feast of the wedding was lost at the Garden of Eden, which God has been looking for throughout the history. Therefore during the Last Days of the world, this wedding ceremony must be restored."

      Harvard professor Karen King announced the discovery of The Gospel of Jesus Wife
    </p><p>
      Havard professor Karen King named the fragment piece as Gospel of Jesus' Wife.  This is by no mean suggesting Jesus was married.
    </p><p>
      The found fragment indicated Jusus dialogue with disciples "Jesus said to them, 'my wife..'  "
    </p><p>
      The main point is 'These signs indicate some controversy over whether women who are sexually active (mothers and wives) can be disciples of Jesus. Other early Christian writings defend marriage and reproduction against fellow Christians who think virginity and celibacy are required for all, or who argue that women are not worthy of life'
    </p><p>
      Where the fragment was being found
    </p><p>
      One very likely possibility is that a papyrus fragment that is this damaged came from an ancient garbage heap, like almost all of the earliest fragments of the New Testament, or it may have come from a burial site. Nothing is known about the circumstances of its discovery, but it had to have come from Egypt where the dry climate allows ancient writings to survive and because it is written in the Coptic form of the Egyptian language
    </p><p>
      Fragment date:
    </p><p>
      Based on analysis, the fragment should be around 7 to 8 centuries (around AD 600 to &amp; 700)
    </p><p>
      How it was discovered:
    </p><p>
      It now belongs to an anonymous private collector who contacted Karen L. King at Harvard Divinity School for help in identifying its contents.

      In the same week that Dr. Hak Ja Han, revered by Unificationists the world over as our True Mother, took the lead as the True Parents on earth, Harvard professor Karen King announced the discovery of The Gospel of Jesus Wife, a fragment of an ancient Christian-Gnostic papyrus in which Jesus mentions his wife and defends her before the other disciples as most worthy. Surely, the timing is no accident, but an indication of Gods work to elevate and establish True Mother in the minds of Christians and Unificationists as the genuine Lady of the Second Advent. For this, we should give thanks to God.

      Now, on the foundation of True Mother victory (of indemnifying the disciples' rejection of Mary Magdalene by going thru the same rejection and accusation), the story of Jesus wife can be revealed to humankind. Don Browns The Da Vinci Code enjoyed extraordinary popularity because the time has come to rehabilitate Mary Magdalene from obscurity. She was the predecessor of True Mother, and True Mother stands on the foundation of her devotion to Jesus.
    </p><p>
      Let us do what Jesus disciples could not, and recognize True Mothers unparalleled devotion and loving oneness with True Father as making her far greater than any disciple possibly could be.

      Some of verses were taken from Gospel of Mary which can be found in:<a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/markdroberts/series/was-jesus-married-a-careful-look-at-the-real-evidence/"> http://www.patheos.com/blogs/markdroberts/series/was-jesus-married-a-careful-look-at-the-real-evidence/</a></p><p/><p>
      According to True Fathers first Principle text, Wolli Wonbon (written in the early 1950s), Jesus was indeed married to Mary Magdalene. It was a conditional marriage, however, because Mary Magdalene also had been sleeping with another man in the Archangel position (Judas Iscariot), who was supposed to give her to Jesus. Mention that Jesus would have to restore Eve in this way is hinted at in Exposition of the Divine Principle in the discussion of Abraham and Sarah in Egypt:
    </p><p/><p>
      Abraham walked this providential course to make a symbolic indemnity condition to restore Adams family... he was deprived of Sarah, who was playing the role of his sister, by the Pharaoh, who represented Satan. He then had to take her back from Pharaoh as his wife... This course which Abraham walked was the model course for Jesus to walk in his day. (p. 209).
    </p><p/><p>
      God set up this situation to restore the Fall of Man. God had created Adam and Eve to become husband and wife, but Lucifer slept with Eve and stole her from Adam. To restore the Fall, this action had to be reversed: an Archangel-type husband would have to give up his wife, representing Eve, to a man in the position of Adam  and do it voluntarily. Thus Pharaoh (the Archangel) was induced to give up Sarah (Eve) to Abraham (Adam).
    </p><p/><p>
      In this regard, Wolli Wonbon describes a triangular relationship between Jesus, Mary Magdalene and Judas, who were in the positions of Adam, Eve and Archangel:
    </p><p/><p>
      Jesus tried to set up Judas wife as the woman in the position of Eve who would fulfill the original purpose of the Will. Mary Magdalene was this woman. Although she was Judas Iscariots lover, she absolutely obeyed Jesus will. Thus, as Satan had taken Eve from Adam, Jesus would try to take Judas wife for himself and thereby fulfill the Will according to the Principle.

      True Father in his speeches often praised Mary Magdalene as superior to all the (male) disciples in terms of her faith, love, and devotion to Jesus. That is the reason why, at his resurrection, Mary Magdalene was the first person to see Jesus after he came out of the tomb (John 20:11-18). It was she who announced the resurrection to the other disciples. However, the real poignancy of that scene was that when she went to embrace Jesus, he stopped her. Father said that Jesus could not hold her, because the failure of that conditional providence meant that she could no longer be in the position of Jesus bride.

      Jesus was the substantial being of the Word. If he had been supported by John and then Israel he could have restored a bride and a family. The mission of the Holy Spirit is to give birth to humankind and bring the children to Father and then together go back to God.

      Jesus suffered a miserable fate. The birds had nests, but the son of man had no place to lay his head. Who made that happen? The leaders of the Jewish people that didn't accept Jesus caused this. So much indemnity and bloodshed came because of that. They should never have allowed the crucifixion to take place. Even the three disciples failed and didn't protect Jesus. They allowed their father to be taken away. I have been offering prayers and devotion to protect and save the Jewish people.

Jesus' death was a tragedy that broke God's heart.

      True Father explains in The Spiritual Rebirth through Jesus and the Holy Spirit, "In Christianity, the Holy Father (Father God) is God and the Holy Son is Jesus. Then, what is the Holy Spirit? The Holy Spirit is the Mother God. You cannot be reborn unless you receive the Holy Spirit which is the Mother God. The Holy Spirit who is the Mother God must give birth. This Holy Spirit longs for Jesus. How much does she long for Jesus? She longs to see Jesus like crazy. You did not have such experience, did you? The longing heart of the Holy Spirit, Mother God toward the bride, husband God must be reflected in the human body. You must be reborn by having that kind of heart. There is no birth possible without going through the love of the parents. This is the Heavenly Principle."

      True Father says in The Rebirth through True Parents and True Children, "...it is the same in the Unification Church today. You all must absolutely fall in love with Father. All men and women should shed tears longing to see Father. You must have a longing heart and love for Father more than for your wife, or husband, and more than for your own children. Unless you have such heart welling up, you cannot be connected to God." (p714)
    </p><p/><p>
      "Through whom do you think you can establish the condition of having been born? Father alone is not enough. You need to go through the True Children. No matter how important Father is, you still must go through not only Father alone, but also Parents and their Children. True Parents will have True Sons and True Daughters. Then, with whom should sisters unite? Sisters should unite with True Parents and True Daughters. Brothers should unite with True Parents and True Sons. Because woman fell first, restoration of woman has to be done first, and then the restoration of man will follow."(p718)
    </p><p/><p>
      "You cannot go into True Mother's womb. Therefore, what you need to do is that you must become one with True Children. You must be in the position of a fetus in the womb through this 3 years period." (p719)
    </p><p/><p>
      True Parents loved Cain children more than Abel children (True Children) True Parents first loved Cain children (us), while sacrificing their own children (Abel children). True Parents expected that eventually Cain children would protect and raise True Children on behalf of True Parents, and would help True Children to become one with True Parents.
    </p><p/><p>
      However, this didn't happen as expected. True Father said, "That has been my life. My life has been that way up until now. I live according to the Principle. I do not directly take care of my children. Even though they live in East Garden, it is not I that teach them every day. Who should educate Adam? The Archangel should do it. It is not God who will do it. Who should educate Father's children? The 36 couples should do it. However, Unification Church does not have the foundation to build the attitude of traditional educational." (Total Indemnity, God's Will and the World. P894)
    </p><p/><p>
      Abel children (True Children) carried the cross because of the Blessed Families (Cain children). Not only that, True Children carried all kinds of our sin, Cain children's sin -- faithlessness, failure to fulfill their responsibilities. True Children had to go through the course of the cross.
    </p><p/><p>
      Now we, as the Cain children, should deeply repent that we have been just receiving True Parents' deep love again and again without knowing the painful heart of True Parents, and without knowing what kind of difficult course True Children have had to go through as they carried the heavy cross of the heart.

      if Jesus thinks that he is the true son of God, there will be no way for those who don't know him to go the path of true son of God. Those who don't know him have no relation with such a position. How can one obtain the qualification that enables them to join Jesus in such a status? You should know clearly that it is the responsibility of the fallen people, not of God or the son of God.

      In Jerusalem, less than 5 percent of the people are Christian; there, the weakest foundation is Christianity. Even today, Jesus has no place to stay there.
    </p><p/><p>
      To indemnify this course the 120 Churches took down the cross -- this was not easy. Then they went to Israel and reconciled with the Rabbis. Archbishop George A Stallings is here. Archbishop Stallings' church is on Capitol Hill -- he was the first to take down the cross. The ACLC Clergy went forward with absolute faith during this time and joined together with Jewish leaders in the historic Jerusalem declaration. Taj Hamad and Rev. Kwak did a good job at educating the Muslim world.
    </p><p/><p>
      All faiths have been embraced. In our work in America -- Minister Farrakhan and our movement joined for the Million Family March with True Parents blessing and it was great victory and Minister Farrakhan became a close ally and friend to True Parents. He showed to our True Parents the utmost respect. Through involvement with True Parent the philosophy of the Nation of Islam has changed. He has expanded his leadership of the Nation of Islam to embrace all people. Taking down the cross was such a difficult direction. I asked Bishop Stallings to take down the cross, and he said if it is Father's direction then I will absolutely follow. He did, and that became the foundation for our work in the first Israel.

      Why? Jesus died (on that level). I am the substitute for Jesus but am (on a) different (level) from Jesus. I am different from Jesus, who came 2000 years ago. The background of my birth is also different from his, and I provided eight textbooks and teaching materials. I am not on the familial level nor the worldwide level either. After going beyond the cosmic level, I obtained the recognition from the spirit world. After that, I obtained the recognition on earth and then when I go to the spirit world, all I have done must be fit there.

      The spirit self's spirit mind and spirit body (mN: God's spirit self's spirit mind and spirit body), which are its "mind" and "body", are inseparable. Therefore, God, who is united with Father in the spirit mind, comes to use Father's spirit body, and consequently, when we see Father in the spirit world, it means we see God. That's why Jesus was called "Immanuel," which means God with us.

      If one believed in Christ individually without forming a family and went to the spirit world, they must resurrect to go to the familial, tribal, national, and worldwide levels. It would take millions of years to accomplish such a course. This applies to Jesus too who has been in paradise. When Jesus resurrected through a certain person, they would say 'I am Jesus.' You must know the principle when you see spiritual phenomena.
