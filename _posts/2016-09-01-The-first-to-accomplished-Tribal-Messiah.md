Testimony of Arcanjo Espindola
Tribal Messiah Ministry
June 5, 2011
Cheon Bok Gung HQ Church
Seoul, Korea

I thank True Parent of Heaven, Earth and Humanity and Hyung Jin Nim for the chance to be here with you now.

My name is Arcanjo Espinoba, I am 63 years old and I am blessing of 1,275 couples in Korea. I was blessed with Jennifer from England. We have one child who is 20 years old. She is 2nd generation blessed couple now, blessed in 2009 with French brother and lives in Paris.
I have 31 years of public life. I entered the church in 1980 when I was 33 years old.

I was a business man and owned a construction company. I abandoned my business after 7-day seminar to follow True Parents. I was a full time member for 7 years, missionary in Baya for 1.5 years, missionary in Bloomena for 3 years and state leader of St. Catherina for 9 years.

#### Had heart problem and was told would only live till 33 years old 

When I met UC when I was 33, I had a heart problem and doctor told me I would only live till 33 years old. I did fund raising and dedicated to providence of God. Afterwards, when I visited the hospital where I was being treated they found I no longer had heart problem. When I went into the hospital, the nurse thought I was a ghost, but the doctors found I had no heart problems.
**The doctor said he didn’t believe in God but was forced to believe it was a miracle because I was completely cured.** I witnessed that I was following True Parents and they had transformed my life and my health. I’ve done work as Tribal Messiah for 21 years. sincere devotion, the sincere condition of God of absolute faith to follow True Parents.
Thruout this time I did various seminars and found people weren’t accepting the words very easily. 

I did special condition of sincere devotion for 7 years I fasted every Friday and only ate 1 meal a day after 5am and took a cold shower, even at time of blessing understanding that I am a sinner and that I am a sinner with many sins. To remove my sins, I made this special condition for 21 years of making HDK of 90 minutes daily, I started to give testimony and changed my life completely.

During this cold bath/fast I went to a city of Akim and there was a simple hotel made of wood and I did a cold shower in this hotel. I used 4 blankets for quilts but couldn’t get warm, then I found that I was standing beside my body which was still sitting on the bed and I could see my body snoring, so I knew I wasn’t dead.
I walked thru the walls, I went outside and walked around then I went back into the hotel room to see if I was still alive. When I came back the last time, I saw light coming down to my body and near the light there was a tunnel, and I started to climb thru that tunnel. The more I went up that tunnel, the more I felt the will to climb. I felt something really good, and I wanted to go higher and higher. I went back to see if I was still alive but I returned to the tunnel until I met a man with a white hat and a white suit. When I went to pass him, he said, “You cannot pass, you must go back to earth and finish your mission.” So I went back.

I made many internal conditions to help people during the time I kept studying and praying and asking True Parents to show me how to help people to restore themselves more quickly and True Father appeared in a dream and told me to do 72 minutes reading Divine Principle and I could change people. People could become better and solve their problems. Then, when True Father ordered the HDK, I started to do 90 minutes daily.

#### Financial difficulty and sell Divine Principle

I had financial difficulty so I started to sell Divine Principle books. During that time, I gave Divine Principle to people. If I gave it to them, they didn’t take it seriously, but when I sold them the Divine Principle book, they made an internal condition and in this way, they started to restore themselves. I sold many Divine Principle books and reached 4,000 Divine Principle and one company bought 100 Divine Principle books in one day.
I started selling the book at $20 now sell it at $35. I give them a condition, and I do a HDK condition with them, then I sell them the book. I read Principle in a loud voice and share with the people, everybody reads and I explain what they don’t understand. As they start understanding the Principle, they become members of the movement.

I found the power of Principle and thru it you can change your life. My members do 90 minutes of principle reading and they do tests until they get good scores. I teach them to prepare their internal heart to become a great man or woman and to fight against the fall. With the knowledge of the fall, young people become purified and they turn themselves eventually into true husbands and true wives.

#### 90 minutes condition per day

I found that the human body is a temple which can only be inhabited by God and **if you do the condition of 90 minutes and if you have a condition of faith in True Parents, Satan cannot touch you.**


#### The effect of doing condition

I give people conditions to do one year, two years, five years, up to 15 years of reading the principle, and **as they begin the condition, old people become younger, people become healthier, they begin to experience more life and more prosperity in everything that they do.**

True Father is the masculine essence of God, in True Mother there is the feminine aspect of God. The Heavenly law that True Parents have brought to the earth is to teach us to dominate the power of evil and bring the power of goodness to make people happy.
True Father went thru a lot of suffering to reach this level that he has reached to become the essence of God on Earth. A life of absolute obedience, absolute faith and 100% absolute unity and absolute responsibility to God with a life of sweat, blood and tears. He opened an extraordinary path for us to find true love, true family, true lineage and to become true children to find God on Earth.

Humanity that follows the satanic tradition has many marriage problems, problems in relationships, problems in health, yet those who follow True Parents only have a life of absolute victory.

#### 90-minute , 3-hr or 9-hr condition to solve your problem

I do HDK, I start at 5am and continue for 90 minutes and every person who is arriving is doing conditions throughout the day. People do 90 minutes every day, sometimes 3 hours, those who have more serious problems, do 9 hours, which is a special condition to recover from their problems.

God and True parents never fail if you have absolute faith and you believe in their power in the essence of the power of God on earth, with the law of True Parents, certainly, in everything you do, you will have victory.
We live in a privileged time where God has sent True Parents to earth and when we fulfill our responsibility, the love of God comes to inhabit in us. I give talks of HDK in companies and in people’s homes. I visit people’s homes in their homes and invite their whole family to to hear the words of True Parents.
I have groups that meet morning, afternoon and night, whether visiting people’s homes or in the HQ. People unite in family in other cities and do HDK and when you have a problem, Divine Principle can solve your problem. You have to love unconditionally, live for others, serve others. Only in this way can you have victory.

When a person reads Divine Principle correctly, when he has HDK he can have victory. But when he stops, he starts to have problems. People who discover Divine Principle and True Parents on Earth have a lot of joy develop a good feeling to follow True Parents.
During 9 hours condition, I serve breakfast, lunch, dinner, I give the best that I have for each person who comes. In my view, everyone who comes to meet me, is a representative sent by True Parents so I can help and save that person.
Divine Principle has all the answers that we need in every area of our life. True Parents is the biggest treasure that God has ever given to earth. True Parents of Humanity have brought hope, faith and a better world, better life, better family and society. We have this privilege of living at this time with True Parents. This is a very special privilege for all of us, because of this, we should take it very seriously, his words, his sermons should be law for us. It is the law of God on the Earth.
True Parents are the essence of True Love, Essence of True Life, Essence of the True Child, Essence of True Happiness.

We have an extraordinary treasure which is True Parents, we have a present which is extraordinary and we still haven’t found out what it’s worth, it’s true value. Only when you do 90 minutes of HDK can you change your life because you will understand the failures of humanity, the sins of humanity. 

#### Cure sickness

**The people who did the 90 minutes with faith, 3 were cured from cancer, 3 children were recovered.**
A blind person started to see, handicapped people started to walk and all kinds of sickness got cured. 

#### Drug addicts

Faith in True Parents and unity with them, responsibility, the law of True Parents turns your life into victory. I worked with people with drug addictions, cocaine, alcohol, I was threatened by the drug dealers, 34 times they tried to kill me. People who want to leave drugs, when they decide, when they really want to change, within 30 days they can come out of the drugs, or 6 months or one year, it depends on the responsibility of each person.
In 20 years, more than 100 people have come away from drugs, come away completely and even today they still read Principle. When people have financial difficulty and do 90 minutes HDK, their financial life changes. An example is a man who had 3 million dollars in debt and 800 bankruptcy petitions and 300 orders of prison against him. He started the HDK condition and today he has 3,000 workers and they all do the HDK condition with him.
When you trust 100% in True Parents, when you understand the value of True Parents and you fulfill your goals and the determination of HDK, certainly, True Parents will never fail you. 

#### Family relationship problem

One man came to my house for the afternoon and he had problems in his relationships. I explained the value of the family, the value of the condition. The wife called and asked, “What did you do? Did you brainwash him? He’s now doing the dishes, he’s taking care of the kids, he bought me a present. From one day to the other, he changed.”

#### A lawyer has problem of the Fall

I want people to understand the value of a true family how to serve and how to love, how to understand the heart of God within the family. A lawyer had a problem, he had the problem of the fall. He left his wife and went to live with his lover. I gave him 40 days condition of reading the Fall of Man and after 40 days he came back to his family and now his family is healed.
Divine Principle explains the victory of God on earth thru True Parents. If you fulfill your responsibility, God will fulfill his responsibility. There was a businessman who left his wife and his wife came to my house and started the HDK condition and now they are a family without problems. 

#### Suicide problem

One person tried suicide several times, but after studying the principle, this suicide spirit left her and now she is a full time member with her sister and they are both preparing to be blessed.

#### Poor family

I knew a very poor person, he worked in a meat factory. One day he started to read Divine Principle and he started to change his life. He eventually became elected as a City Counsellor. He started 90 minutes every day and he would go on his bicycle to do his election campaign. Everyone was laughing at him, thinking he was stupid. When the election finished, he was the candidate with the most votes. He has been City Counsellor for a number of terms and is now Vice President of the City Council.

#### Nun with health problem

There was a nun who had many health problems and she started reading Divine Principle and got rid of her problems and is now in a very good situation. When you read Principle with faith when you believe 100% in True Parents, you only have victory.

#### My tribe

I have 720 families in my Tribe. I have 120 families who follow True Parents. I have members who are house mates, lawyers, a senator, a state governor, politicians, people from every level of society engineers, doctors, military, everybody comes together and does HDK in my house.

#### City Counsellor read Divine Principle 360 times

This City Counsellor, who does the condition for 15 years, has already read the entire Divine Principle 360 times. I did this condition for 21 years and I continue to read Divine Principle. The more you read Principle, the more you understand the value of True Parents, True Family and our movement that God sent as a treasure for each one of us. You cannot have victory unless you obey the law, follow True Parents. You cannot have victory alone, only with True parents.
One thing I can say certainly, those who do HDK correctly, who read Divine Principle, the more they read, the more they do HDK, the more they understand the value of True Parents, they will have more and more victory. Your life gets better, people get better, everything around you gets better. True Father said, as you change, everything around you changes.

#### How he take care his daughter

When my daughter was born I was very worried about her. How to educate her because I had my public mission and I dedicated myself to the people and I had the inspiration from God to take her with me to the HDK. From 10 days old, I would take her to the HDK meeting so she heard it every day. Thru Divine Principle the True Parents educated her, she was always obedient, she was always responsible, she participated in various projects and now she is blessed living in Paris with her French husband.

#### Witness and convince people the value of True Parernts

When you give witness correctly, when you speak with the heart of True Parents, when you convince the people of the value of True Parents, they start to change their lives. And the person that changes their life, they become different, and the people around them start to accept and start to follow. Now I have 50 people in the position of John the Baptist. I have a journalist who has brought 55 people and all of them do 90 minutes daily HDK. When you renounce all the pleasures of the earth to follow the True Parents, certainly everything that you need will be taken care of.

#### Young people
It is very important for young people to understand that true love, true family can be found with True Parents. In your life, everything you need, in study, married life will be done by True Parents, they know the person who is best to be your spouse, nobody is better.

#### You need to change first

We have a tendency to want our brother to change, our wife to change, to want our child to change. this is a fallen tendency, it is wrong. Thru the Divine Principle I relearned that I am the one who needs to change, to become a better brother, a better husband, better family and a better friend.
When you change, you become an example and other people can follow your example and change, too. If enough people can follow True Parents the world will change. The blessings of God are on Earth in the hands of True Parents the essence of true love, true prosperity is in the hands of True Parents.
This can only become realized if you fulfill faithfully with your sincere heart, sincere life, sincere devotion to serve True Parents. I want to leave my message to all the young people, to be happy with True Parents, without them, there is no happiness. They have opened all the paths in the physical and spiritual world all the paths which we need to walk have been opened by True Parents with blood sweat and tears. We simply need to obey their laws and follow them on earth.
For this, you need determination, True parents, everything he says, he does it and and completes it and if we have this type of determination, fulfilling his laws, obeying him, being faithful to him, certainly we will be happy.

#### Want to register myself in 2013

I dedicate my life, my wife’s, my child’s to follow True Parents eternally, even if I have to die, I will live serving True Parents eternally. I am dedicating myself every day with my tribe, my brothers we are praying for the unification of North and South Korea and the restoration and I want to get the victory of Tribal Messiah in the time of the registration in 2013 to register my tribe.
The true Parents of the Unification Church, I have nothing to complain about, only eternal gratitude and every day, people can become very happy thru True Parents. I thank God and True Parents of Heaven, Earth and Humanity to be together with you and I thank Rev. Hyung Jin Nim for this opportunity to be with him and you.

Thank you very much.
